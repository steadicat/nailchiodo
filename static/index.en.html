        <p>being a Farewell Letter in Verse <br />
to Relatives, Friends, and Acquaintances <br />
<br>  </p>

<p>One should not be surprised, as <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-ludwig" href="#fn-ludwig">Ludwig</a> observed, <br />
when those who possess not the key <br />
to a lock of one&#8217;s own creation fail to accede <br />
to whatever, by its means, one would preserve <br />
from indiscreet and inopportune attention. <br />
Prosody can either entice or dissuade: <br />
those whom it fails to persuade <br />
cannot delve into the verses in question. <br />
The privacy formal constraints thus afford, <br />
the cover they provide against ill-disposed scrutiny, <br />
is both a privilege and an opportunity <br />
by which a poem&#8217;s point may be&nbsp;scored.    </p>

<p>Take, for example, the present composition: <br />
thanks to rhymes and rhythms of uncertain distinction <br />
it is sure to turn off both die-hard esthetes <br />
and inveterate prose-mongers after but a few feet. <br />
What there may still be of value in it <br />
will depend entirely on its potential effect, <br />
not upon those contingents of stiff necks, <br />
but on that exiguous minority who thinks <br />
there are always important new things to be learned <br />
that can only be stumbled into as it were, <br />
since our thoughts are rambling by nature; <br />
and that a poem that rambles on from beginning to end <br />
may in fact be where best to first learn&nbsp;them.    </p>

<p>I have become sick and will soon meet my maker. <br />
Confident, thanks to their lackadaisical meter, <br />
that I can proceed to speak frankly and freely <br />
without fear of being overheard by anyone <em>really</em> <br />
not in tune with the spirit of these lines, <br />
I shall try to commit to paper considerations <br />
hopefully of interest and use to at least some <br />
of those who do lend an ear and their time – <br />
“&#8230; and I&#8217;ll try not to sing out of&nbsp;key.”    </p>

<p>“Dear relatives, friends, and acquaintances,” <br />
that is how I&#8217;ll begin what I now know must be <br />
a letter of farewell to all whom I recall <br />
and who may remember me: a poem that bares <br />
my thoughts and feelings about departure; <br />
one which, though of unproven lyrical quality, <br />
might still gratify a natural&nbsp;curiosity.    </p>

<p>“I write to you from a new, standing position <br />
I&#8217;ve adopted because less painful to me than sitting. <br />
I won&#8217;t go into the etiology of my specific condition: <br />
suffice it to say it is skeletal, terminal, and befitting <br />
a poet who began his inquiry long ago, <br />
intrigued by pain&#8217;s forms from the word&nbsp;go.    </p>

<p>“Apart from a bout with acute encephalitis <br />
(among the most excruciating of nature&#8217;s devices, <br />
rather like a screw applied to your skull), <br />
luckily by doctors promptly cured, <br />
back when I was a kid, I&#8217;ve no woe to mull <br />
over for having been by my body endured <br />
in all of sixty-two years of a bountiful life. <br />
Most of the agony encountered until <br />
only five months ago has been spiritual. <br />
More or less all that I&#8217;ve gathered from mental strife, <br />
I&#8217;ve also managed to keep record of, <br />
so it is meet that I should finish my treatment <br />
of dolorous lessons with what recent events <br />
have taught me of pain&#8217;s push come to&nbsp;shove.    </p>

<p>“Very sharp physical suffering has a way <br />
of sweeping aside the entire spectrum of worries <br />
that normally occupy a man&#8217;s day; <br />
without them to distract him, it hurries <br />
his thoughts straight toward a paramount goal: <br />
to either obtain relief or die as soon as possible. <br />
Ways of killing oneself that once appeared <br />
impracticable suddenly seem feasible <br />
after all; technical hurdles are cleared, <br />
or all too easily dismissed with a shrug. <br />
If it weren&#8217;t for stopgap palliative drugs <br />
I would not be here now, still standing tall, <br />
writing a long parting letter to you&nbsp;all.    </p>

<p>“With the aid of those medicines one can <br />
again aspire to virtue, to the ideal of a <em>mens sana <br />
in corpore moribundo</em>, to putting to best use <br />
the time one has left. But the truce <br />
with death cannot, as we know, last forever: <br />
what such best practice will consist in <br />
remains an exquisitely personal matter <br />
of style, taste, and the values they underpin. <br />
If adding a few last points to an already long segment <br />
is one&#8217;s cup of tea, fine. I would rather <br />
have mine be a bit shorter at the end and bent <br />
to form a circle, take things into my own hands. <br />
Of course, I live alone and don&#8217;t have any&nbsp;children.    </p>

<p>“I apologize in advance for any surprise <br />
my suicide may cause: I&#8217;ve tried to explain why <br />
it is <em>d&#8217;oblige</em>. More interesting to my mind <br />
is the <em>way</em> I am going about it – not <br />
all on my own, but with the help of others. <br />
I enjoy the challenge advocacy <br />
poses to poetry, and to do justice <br />
to the team in question is not easy; <br />
but, it goes without saying, I&#8217;ll do the best I&nbsp;can.    </p>

<p>“By helping me to die by my own hand, <br />
they are most probably saving my life <br />
from the disparagement of overtime <br />
spent at the mercy of unidentified others – <br />
not least were I instead to use a knife <br />
on myself and botch it up miserably! <br />
That is where they draw their line for dignity <br />
in death, and it is difficult not to agree <br />
if one knows what they are talking about. <br />
One doesn&#8217;t have to be on one&#8217;s way out <br />
to learn why, where, and how they operate, <br />
to support their pro-health-to-the-last, <br />
humanitarian association: just go straight <br />
to their website, www.dignitas.ch, <br />
and think of your own future, what it might reserve. <br />
The patient&#8217;s instructions and protection service <br />
they offer is well worth subscribing to <br />
when death seems still far from the&nbsp;corner.    </p>

<p>“But enough talk of death! Lest the relatives <br />
disown, the friends disavow, the acquaintances <br />
sneer if ever they chance to think of me. <br />
It is what I am departing <em>from</em>, not how <br />
or where I am departing <em>to</em> – by my very heart <br />
and mind – that is the real crux of this letter. <br />
I don&#8217;t mean the larger world outside, that hootenanny, <br />
but all whom I cherish and cannot write to <br />
one at a time because they are too many <br />
and there would be too much for me to say. <br />
The personal exchanges that once made our day, <br />
what we have already shared, will have to&nbsp;do.    </p>

<p>“May this so-long epistle with occasional rhymes <br />
also in some manner serve to make up <br />
for the fact that, being quite rushed, <br />
I shall fail to rendezvous one last time <br />
even with those of you within easy reach. <br />
But here I trust that all will believe <br />
I do indeed regret not feasting my eyes <br />
again upon them, not giving in to a sob or a sigh <br />
while trying to remain as composed as I can; <br />
but, most of all, not gently shaking their hand <br />
as in those kindred scenes once portrayed <br />
in bas-relief on ancient Greek funerary&nbsp;stelae.    </p>

<p>“I started by telling I was in a standing <br />
position as I wrote you, which indeed <br />
remains more congenial than others to me <br />
even as I near the end of these ramblings. <br />
All my previous poetry, I wrote recumbent: <br />
it has even been suggested by an Austrian lady <br />
that if ever a statue were to be made of me <br />
it would be most true to its subject <br />
if it showed him to be lying in bed. <br />
She said it – bless her kind soul! – sarcastically, <br />
but the idea is a good one and, quite frankly, <br />
were it to be done by a humorous sculptor, <br />
I would not object to being so&nbsp;honored.    </p>

<p>“My dears, the time has come to finally part. <br />
In valediction, take this token of a rambler&#8217;s&nbsp;art.”    </p>
