  <h1>Highway of the&nbsp;Sun</h1>

  <div id="description">
    <p>from the Italian of Alessandro&nbsp;Ricci</p>

  </div>

  <p>I know by heart quite a number of poems <br />
by Lowry, some Latin passages, two <br />
or three letters of Dylan Thomas <br />
and even more. I like <br />
and know how to make a car slide <br />
by countersteering in fast curves. <br />
In brief, I am a capable driver <br />
with an education. Sooner or later <br />
the many whom I have overtaken, whom <br />
I shall overtake, enter the roadside <br />
coffee shops of service stations, <br />
but I remain, undoubtedly, <br />
as Teacher told Mother, <br />
sensitive in a way that is altogether different. <br />
It may well be true that this is the case, <br />
you slovenly ones crowded around the&nbsp;register.  </p>

<p>Tonight I feel tired for you <br />
as well, I wear your faces from out of the dark <br />
along with my own, I feel <br />
as if from Albany or Mississippi, with or without <br />
sideburns and family, salesman <br />
or immigrant, man or man. <br />
                                           I&#8217;ve finished <br />
my sandwich, my coffee, I&#8217;ve finished <br />
my cigarette as well, and on this Friday, I&#8217;m&nbsp;sleepy.  </p>

<p>I would love life even <br />
by neon light, amid the blasts <br />
of the <em>expresso</em> maker, the nickels <br />
left as tips, the idiot trilling <br />
of the pinball machines in the back. <br />
I would love it, but can&#8217;t.  I now see, clear- <br />
sightedly?, that the nightmare will (not) last. <br />
I stand like this, <br />
among the people who do not know it, who must not <br />
know it. <br />
And why is it&nbsp;so?  </p>

<p>The cashier has an exhausted jacket <br />
and banana yellow eyes. No, it&#8217;s the other way round, <br />
words get it wrong all the time; God, I pray you <br />
that he not understand, that he not read my thoughts <br />
thus mistaken, that he not be&nbsp;offended.  </p>

<p>I look at him with love. He waits for me to&nbsp;pay.  </p>

<p class="right">Alessandro&nbsp;Ricci</p>
