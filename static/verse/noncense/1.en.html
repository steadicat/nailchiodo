<p>Rarely – but it happens – I feel on top of it: <br />
Everyone has their place in the world, you see. <br />
I may have just finished getting <br />
My load of porn, of something strong <br />
In the last few days (by which I mean <br />
Being drawn to any old, lewd extreme) <br />
And, one morning, I’ll know what to dream, <br />
Backed by the invisible army <br />
Time’s tested trials have set behind me. <br />
I point it out as something curious: <br />
An extraordinary homeopathic effect, <br />
Exerted by certain women, upon spurious <br />
Thoughts parading in man’s intellect. <br />
The mechanism—without getting enmeshed <br />
In problems philosophical or wanting to sound preachy— <br />
Brings to mind that phrase of Nietzsche <br />
“Let virtue sleep, it will awake refreshed.” <br />
In any case it all only rarely happens <br />
And, as always with this sort of potion, <br />
Careful dosage is of the utmost importance. <br />
Like a deficiency, an excess of such conjuring <br />
(Hard to envisage as it might be) <br />
Leads the malady into the chronic ring; <br />
And after that, dear reader, you will concede, <br />
The only remedy which can do no harm <br />
Is that chill severity, the superego’s charm. <br />
Having survived the world this long <br />
And lived somewhat in it as well, <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-I-prefer" href="#fn-I-prefer">I prefer lofty thoughts expressed in song</a> <br />
Which uplift the heart as they cast their spell; <br />
So while on this subject of “serious chores”, <br />
I would take the opportunity to dwell <br />
On the travail and grand reward <br />
Behind some natty shows and tells. <br />
For example: a close skimming of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-de-tocquev" href="#fn-de-tocquev">De Tocqueville</a> <br />
On the question of the different role <br />
Befallen the individual <br />
In times and places democratic <br />
(As opposed to aristo-so, for those who haven’t read him), <br />
Not unlike a knot’s reaching the comb <br />
Can be quite jarring to the cerebral zone. <br />
I refer especially to <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-thoughts" href="#fn-thoughts">his thoughts <br />
On the future course of Art <br />
And of Poetry in particular</a>. <br />
Incidentally, today I visited <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-xerox-parc" href="#fn-xerox-parc">Xerox Parc</a> <br />
In Palo Alto (and here I owe it <br />
To those who might know Tocqueville <br />
But perhaps not Xerox, to say a bit <br />
About what sort of box it is: <br />
A centre where some anthropologists, <br />
Philosophers, “subject matter experts”, <br />
Cognitive psychologists and <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-ai" href="#fn-ai"><span class="caps">A.I.</span></a> folk, <br />
All of whom share the belief that computing is a <em>language</em>— <br />
And, seemingly, that life is not a joke— <br />
Work together to develop theories <br />
About how people learn, and to package <br />
Them, thus responding to the need <br />
By the company’s <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-ceo" href="#fn-ceo"><span class="caps">C.E.O.</span></a> perceived, <br />
That citizens engage in what they call <br />
“Lifelong learning”&#8230;.); I left there <br />
Wondering on the one hand <br />
What a lifetime’s having to play hooky <br />
Might be like, a prospect rather spooky <br />
Even for the most determined cad, <br />
And, even more, what such purveyors <br />
Of constant assimilation can truly have in common <br />
With one whom <em>caution</em> bids him, <br />
In dealing with others, to try to do them <br />
First and foremost only the least <em>harm</em>. <br />
For such, at least, is the poet’s calling: <br />
To not pose the problems he tries to solve. <br />
I do not want to spark alarm <br />
But the need is urgent hands be extended <br />
To these would-be-harmless-meddlers- <br />
In-the-depths-of-others, before they drift too far: <br />
Since it’s not likely anyone will stop them, <br />
Let them by many be at least <em>informed</em>. <br />
In a democracy, Tocqueville understood, <br />
Liberty, equality, and brotherhood <br />
Don’t always go together; as he was <em>good</em>, <br />
He thought there was much yet to learn <br />
And be affirmed in regard to it: <br />
That people might from one another profit <br />
In Spirit, and not just by what they earn. <br />
Most local news never gets diffused <br />
Beyond a certain border or radius, <br />
And an efficient solution to a problem, <br />
Discovered in some remote canton, <br />
May not find its way to the attention <br />
Of others who, because they <em>grapple</em> with it, <br />
Think they are the centre of all the action. <br />
And such is the rift now separating Wisdom <br />
Even from the Nobel Prize of some, <br />
That Poetry, at the head of all the Arts, <br />
Must shift its mode of operation, <br />
Wield its warring, addressive parts, <br />
Found the bridge between the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-two-cultur" href="#fn-two-cultur">“Two Cultures”</a>. <br />
The image of an open-faced, pretty little girl <br />
Blowing kisses to a boy—one still in his anal phase— <br />
Suggests itself as an example of that pearl <br />
Of a Law of Nature which binds, and weighs <br />
Upon, many an ardent humanist in the world. <br />
Plato (in his Seventh Letter to <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-dionysus" href="#fn-dionysus">Dionysus</a>) <br />
Said lovers of knowledge should use scare tactics <br />
To win people to their side, but now the fuss <br />
Is everywhere and, for want of tricks, <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-sophies-lo" href="#fn-sophies-lo">Sophie’s lovers</a> must be more audacious, <br />
Put their several genitals on the line. <br />
Let’s get <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-doctor-rut" href="#fn-doctor-rut">Doctor Ruth</a> to write a program <br />
On how to optimise the orgasm; <br />
Let’s dis-invent a technology—though it be late— <br />
And withhold the secrets from the State; <br />
But, most of all, let’s find a way: <br />
The present moment is at stake. <br />
One of the main reasons for the distance <br />
Between the scientific and humanistic reigns <br />
Is that few humanists understand Math <br />
And the haunts on the scientific plain; <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-par-contr" href="#fn-par-contr"> <em>Par contre</em></a>, quite widespread among our white-smocked crew <br />
Is the impression that what we in tweed do <br />
Is <em>arcane</em>. Such Philistinism, I would argue, <br />
Effects a stretching of human patience <br />
As great as any ever to rack Science <br />
Even during the Inquisition. The <em>essence</em> <br />
Of the work of artist, writer, critic, scholar, <br />
Is to kindle flames, consuming ones— <br />
As can make hearts <span class="caps">HOLLER</span>— <br />
That Humanity may not lose its name; <br />
But the grey shadows of neglect <br />
Cast on this fact by scientific bastions— <br />
By their nobilities as well as peons— <br />
Deep into societies spread disrespect <br />
For true culture. The process has been going on <br />
So intensively and for so long <br />
One finds obstacles in the way, <br />
In trying to cope with the phenomena, <br />
That one could never have imagined. <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-eppur" href="#fn-eppur"> <em>Eppur si muore</em></a>.  </p>

<p>cf.

It must, as it seems to me, be possible to gather from this how far my thinking belongs to the present, future or past.
