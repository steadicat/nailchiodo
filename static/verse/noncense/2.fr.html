<p><a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-merleau" href="#fn-merleau">Merleau-Ponty is right</a>: only by silence <br />
Are words redeemed. Only by the ability <br />
And strength to inspect the grounds, <br />
Even slowly, is our own monstrous vision <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-harnessed" href="#fn-harnessed">Harnessed</a> – to use a delightful term <br />
Of Seamus Heaney’s. And that’s the quick, <br />
The only quick there is&#8230;. <br />
When Dionysus the God (not the Tyrant <br />
Of Syracuse whom Plato wrote to) <br />
His image in a glass sought askance, <br />
It was the world which appeared to his view, <br />
He came into his own just by chance. <br />
Something similar happens in democratic milieu; <br />
But the divine element in the experience <br />
Is, through fault of no one, hard to hold onto. <br />
&#8220;<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-cette" href="#fn-cette"><em>Voyez-vous cette tête?</em></a> …&#8221; I would counter, <br />
&#8220;…<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-avec-cett" href="#fn-avec-cett"><em>Avec cette tête, je bouleverserai <br />
Tout obstacle à la divinité sur la Terre!</em></a>&#8221; <br />
Our heads are masks in Nature’s play, <br />
Three-dimensional, planted neck and crop <br />
Atop our bodies, the vital costume. <br />
As also many a bad parent has proved, <br />
Genetically and otherwise <br />
They can easily be destroyed <br />
At any time in their role’s cycle. <br />
Every head will get all sorts of battering <br />
Before it’s through, though, <br />
All that grey matter inside being <br />
The favourite target for <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-darts-of-a" href="#fn-darts-of-a">darts of Apollo</a>— <br />
Who, we all know, can be simple and cruel. <br />
But, whatever its contents, a head does a job <br />
To express them: by Nature it is equipped <br />
To do so; what with the eyes to laugh and to sob, <br />
Nose to nudge and to kiss, forehead to hit with, <br />
Hair to wave to flutter to tickle <br />
Warm seduce frighten and prick, <br />
Skin, muscle to relax pull or wrinkle— <br />
I won’t even mention the mouth and what it can think— <br />
Only the ears are at a loss, really; <br />
But by a fabulous trick they too can wiggle. <br />
And I confess to an evolutionary bias: <br />
What other species holds its head as high as, <br />
As upright upon the spine as Man? <br />
Everything he is, he owes it to the plan <br />
That proffered his brain to the heavens. <br />
Yet, as Goethe once said: “What is hardest <br />
In the world? That which seems the simplest: <br />
To see with the eyes what is in front of the eyes.” <br />
Thus it is that in democracies, <br />
Where a man can see all of his fellows <br />
When he surveys himself, amid too many “hellos” <br />
And “what-can-I-do-for-yous”, <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-a-real-bef" href="#fn-a-real-bef">a real, befuddled animal</a> <br />
Slights the sense-studded coffer which is his skull. <br />
Luckily, he can lean and vault on polls <br />
To try to stay abreast of goals <br />
He might consider to enhance his Freedom: <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-vanna-whit" href="#fn-vanna-whit">Vanna White</a> may not be optimum for <em>him</em> <br />
But, surely, somewhere in his head <br />
He can find it to let her stay in bed; <br />
And if he truly has had enough of beer, <br />
With the eerie cool of a <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-second-lea" href="#fn-second-lea">second Lear</a> <br />
He can upstage both fridge and belly <br />
And, by Grace of God, unplug the telly. <br />
Then, a little more peaceful if no less alone, <br />
He might to this of all poems turn <br />
And be mirrored Finite and&nbsp;Eternal.  </p>
