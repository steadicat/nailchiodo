<p>The ponderous kerygmas are at last on record: <br />
be they right on the mark or off by a long shot, <br />
I trust I have neither peddled nor bought <br />
articles of faith that cannot be reckoned. <br />
Now I shall ponder Kerry’s charisma <br />
with a lighter heart, and not compound&nbsp;enigmas.  </p>

<p>Woman, artist, mystic: she was already all three <br />
in the bud when I met her, with more than a tinge <br />
of natural kindness and comical flair mixed in. <br />
The Earth had just begun its seventeenth <br />
orbit around the Sun with her on it, <br />
while the Moon—whose phases set the rhythm <br />
of the waxing and waning of moods from the gut, of uterine blood <br />
the ebb and flood—unveiled to her its full face <br />
for the two-hundredth time: without a trace of impatience, <br />
it implied the moment to blossom had come. <br />
And blossom she did, with a smile in which bloomed <br />
special promise for me of all people: a boon like a boom <br />
that raised my prospect all the way up to the&nbsp;stars.  </p>

<p>She fared forth a magnetic poetess when we met <br />
(“… Marry the messenger that brings the dark light <br />
And the thrashing movement within his chest <br />
Flaming the residue of filtered moonlight <br />
Casting away the best….”), whereas I laid my bet <br />
rather more on painting and the visual arts <br />
as means by and through which to convey <br />
the deepest impressions comprising my days. <br />
When we encountered again many, many <br />
years later, she remarked how curious it was <br />
that we had each specialized in the other’s <br />
original craft: I had not swapped my brush for her pen, <br />
nor had she left a page blank to bedaub a canvass, <br />
yet the common pursuit of a veridical language <br />
had caused us both to revise our artistic plans. <br />
The sad truth about the way the world was evolving, <br />
the uncontainable, swelling tide of mediocrity <br />
dumbing down everything that lay in its path <br />
had forced us to set aside our envisaged professions— <br />
which had been architecture in her case, film direction <br />
in mine—in favor of activities we could engage in <br />
without need of others, independent of markets that catered <br />
to the brutalized masses they themselves had&nbsp;created.  </p>

<p>I could think of nothing less tasteful than staging <br />
gaudy or maudlin <em>mises en scène</em> for the dregs of humanity, <br />
and one final downward tug at my vanity <br />
told me it was high time I learned how to write. <br />
Unlikely as it would be that I should ever be published <br />
and find place in the store chains alongside the rubbish, <br />
at least I could aspire to put in black and white <br />
my own values, my own tastes, my own reactions: <br />
may you rot, brave new dump, with all your contraptions; <br />
I shall cherish the loves of which you will perish in&nbsp;spite!  </p>

<p>Of Kerry’s scrape with the sky-scraping crowd— <br />
if indeed there ever was one—I know nothing about; <br />
I heard she changed career, that her ideas took flight <br />
in search of the origin of perspective in Christian art, <br />
and that the fact it lay secreted inside Giotto’s heart <br />
made her use her own to bring it into view: <br />
a novel approach which explains the arch claim of the girl <br />
to be the greatest living art historian in the&nbsp;world.  </p>

<p>Giotto was the harbinger of a radically new <br />
vision and style in his time, who wrested the Western eye <br />
from the hypnotic stare of stock-still Byzantine icons, <br />
set it free to dance once again as in Classical times <br />
over surfaces modeled by color and reflected light; <br />
he reaffirmed the meaning of the human plight <br />
with the increased complexity of motifs derived <br />
from the great Christian spiritual experience; <br />
to precious and dispersed Gothic leanings, <br />
he opposed the renewed demands of what is essential— <br />
brought linear perspective back into the proscenium, <br />
which had flattened since the end of the Roman imperium. <br />
But, as Kerry the mystic will tell you, nothing is&nbsp;coincidental.  </p>

<p>It would transcend the scope of this memoir in verse <br />
to offer more than a glimpse of the jocund universe <br />
that her melodramatic approach discloses. <br />
Unexpected turns of events at every corner <br />
surprise one each time a metaphorical cornea <br />
brings some added symbolic depth into focus. <br />
Thus, the five stigmata of Francis in a famous fresco— <br />
Karl, Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo <br />
Kerry calls them in honor of the “Jesters <br />
of God”, as the Saint referred to his acolytes— <br />
are the origins and ends of as many modes of sight, <br />
ideal, empathic wounds that are certain to fester <br />
if not promptly dressed and seen in the right&nbsp;light.  </p>

<p>For my part, I have always wondered whom Christ <br />
is actually looking at as He stares straight into and through <br />
Judas’s face in the panel at the Arena chapel. <br />
If one took, so to speak, a theoretical scalpel <br />
to a spot just in front of His eyes, the view <br />
of the hidden horizon that would thereby be opened <br />
would coincide with the vanishing point in that moment. <br />
It would reveal the invisible line that, in effect, <br />
snatches us like fishes out of our reveries <br />
and draws us, by the collar or gills, entirely <br />
into the picture, all the way to the aleph <br />
of the murderous kiss—where we become Judas; <br />
where Jesus, transfixed, gazes inside <em>us</em>.  </p>

<p>Or even, conversely, if it is we the sons and daughters <br />
of Man who are about to be slobbered upon <br />
by the fink, there is still the same uncommon <br />
array of temporal instances which are operative <br />
in that instant: the original betrayal <br />
two millennia ago, Giotto’s portrayal <br />
of it twelve centuries later, our personal <br />
acquaintance with the Biblical episode <br />
in our own lifetime, and the current epiphanic <br />
event brought to a head by the orthogonal <br />
along which we would probe to the infinite; <br />
whatever way you look at it, the result is&nbsp;exquisite.</p>
