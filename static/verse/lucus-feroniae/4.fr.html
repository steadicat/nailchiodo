<p>Though products of our country and of our generation, <br />
in the search for identities and lasting vocations <br />
we five Midwesterners commerced in wares <br />
of all kinds of different origins and implications: <br />
Tom did his ecstatic Aretha Franklin imitations, <br />
and of Earl “the Pearl” Monroe twisting in the air; <br />
Fred took me through the steps of Gödel’s Theorem, <br />
became the nation’s proto-hacker <em>ante litteram</em>; <br />
Kerry brooded through the plays of Harold Pinter, <br />
one of the first persons west of the Mississippi <br />
to have heard of him; while Scott, rather more simply, <br />
invoked Martin Luther King and Gandhi to kill the&nbsp;winter.  </p>

<p>I counted myself an American then and will continue <br />
to do so as long as I live, even if it would be more true <br />
to describe me as an odd hybrid with solid roots <br />
both in Europe and in the States, who will spare the reader <br />
the tedious account of his commuting across the seas. <br />
Not being one of those animals who only eats roots <br />
shoots and leaves (though there be many of those too <br />
on both continents), old-world refinements proved <br />
effective in gaining me the esteem of my pals. <br />
There is an epigram I had discovered in Proust <br />
that boosted my credit as a wit in the group <br />
and still, to this very day, has me baffled: <br />
“To hope without hope, which would be wise, is impossible.”— <br />
ominous words, as might have come straight from the Sybil <br />
and point to the tragic sense of the stories <br />
of the likes of us with no choice but to follow <br />
our tastes in a world ever harder to&nbsp;swallow.  </p>

<p>Back in those years, however, the future looked rosy <br />
compared to today. Gandhi, Hammarskjöld (whose <em>Markings</em> <br />
had deeply scored me), <span class="caps">JFK</span>—all had vanished darkly; <br />
and the reverend King with Robert Kennedy one famous spring <br />
followed suit; but Allende had not even been elected yet, <br />
nor had the pope stood on the balcony alongside Pinochet. <br />
Indeed, what I have always found truly troubling <br />
are not so much the blows dealt to due process <em>per se</em>, <br />
as the punctually mushy, circumstantial reactions of persons <br />
of so-called learning to the most dire watersheds: <br />
veritable <em>non sequiturs</em> that the schizoid media <br />
mirror but originate in the basic schizo-<em>phrenia</em> <br />
of the middle-class, trapped in between the quick and the&nbsp;dead.  </p>

<p>At this point, I wish I could say “But I digress!” <br />
and go off on an actual tangent, leave unaddressed <br />
the tricky question of socio-cultural extraction. <br />
For we ourselves were all middle-class kids, <br />
subject to the same conflicts of interest and victims <br />
of the same divided conscience as the next man; <br />
so how to explain the origin of the specificities <br />
that formed the basis of our elected affinities <br />
without referring to those very parents <br />
whom we were supposed to be rebelling against <br />
but who, in reality, had just begun to exert their influence <br />
<em>through</em> us, via our own behavioral&nbsp;patterns?  </p>

<p>Probably the deepest parentally-induced trait <br />
that we all had in common was a disdain <br />
for social climbing: a pride of spirit <br />
that prevented us from aspiring to being any richer <br />
in material terms or socially more in the picture <br />
than we already were; and, of course, strongly limited <br />
the likelihood we should ever become “winners”. <br />
In truth, we had always had at our finger- <br />
tips everything that we really needed; <br />
nor were our mothers and fathers determined to make <br />
us into vicarious successes only for the sake <br />
of some old fear or resentment of theirs, with deeds <br />
whose consequences none could predict. <br />
The freedom they fostered was authentic <br />
and, therefore, necessarily structured— <br />
moral integrity, intellectual honesty, <br />
and a fundamentally inclusive bonhomie <br />
surged as triple pillars of our liberal&nbsp;culture.  </p>

<p>To stand by these qualities amounts to putting <br />
one’s own interest and that of others on near-equal footing, <br />
a graceful stance which has belonged both to enduring <br />
empires and to the smallest tight-knit sodality. <br />
That we mistook such ingenuousness for normality <br />
speaks thus not only of the more than a few things <br />
we had yet to learn, but also of an ancient <br />
wisdom that flowed unperturbed in the vein, <br />
of the broader framework of civilization <br />
within which we would all meet our&nbsp;fate.  </p>

<p>Evening has again fallen in this country place <br />
where Hannibal’s elephants once stationed. <br />
My book tells that if his cause had not been disparaged <br />
by factious oligarchs back at his own Carthage, <br />
he could have taken Rome without any problem. <br />
It just shows to go you, don’t it, how silly <br />
oligarchs will be? And how puerile the vanity <br />
of the society that comes to depend on&nbsp;them.</p>
