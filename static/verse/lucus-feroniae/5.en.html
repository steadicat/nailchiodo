<p>More than any other thing, it is our <em>priorities</em> <br />
that served us rightly, helped to satisfy—or at least <br />
to assuage—a great many yearnings. There is little <br />
that I know in detail about the varied lives <br />
of the others in my quintet since the time <br />
of our scattering, when after high school we hit <br />
the road and careered down separate paths: <br />
the only experience I can go through the math <br />
of point by point is my own; but on the basis <br />
of what I do know from or about them, I can tell <br />
that all have used their fancy’s scimitar well <br />
to preserve some semblance of peace in the&nbsp;oasis.  </p>

<p>Tom has refused all hypocritic oath <br />
and, like a true captain of the only same boat <br />
that everyone is on, has instead become a doctor <br />
specialized in the health care of the working. <br />
He is married to a woman of many noteworthy <br />
achievements &#8230; yet, rather than play proctor <br />
to him, I shall quote from the e-mail he wrote me <br />
not long ago: “Hi Luigi, yes was this ever a surprise! <br />
So very nice to hear from you! As you probably surmised <br />
from the web site, my life has been almost anything but ‘artsy’. <br />
My wife of eleven-plus years, Bonnie, is ten years older than me, <br />
was in Ghana in the second Peace Corps group ever, <br />
went to Oberlin to become a serious piano/violin player <br />
(and ended up a chemistry major), taught at Malcolm X <br />
in Chicago in the late sixties, got a PhD in ‘Industrial Engineering’ <br />
(her dissertation was on the politics of abortion—she used to be <br />
a member of ‘Jane’, a collective of women who performed <br />
illegal abortions without a physician before Roe versus Wade), <br />
taught at Georgia Tech and the University of Michigan, <br />
did lots of international consulting on women’s health issues, <br />
and is now a serious weaver (and Mom). We have two adopted daughters <br />
(we were in the birthing room both times), Lucy age ten and Lily age four: <br />
a couple of high-energy, forceful personalities. <br />
Besides work, almost all the fabric of my life revolves around them. <br />
I work too hard but do a wide variety of often interesting things <br />
and, sometimes, seem to make a real difference. <br />
Back problems of uncertain diagnosis since the late seventies— <br />
actually doing better than ever with this and not much interference <br />
with lifestyle and activities. We were in South Africa <br />
for a sabbatical year in ’93-’94 <br />
and return there for another year in July: <br />
incredibly beautiful, complex, fascinating place. <br />
So happens last week I was in <span class="caps">NYC</span> and saw Kerry <br />
for the first time in twelve years—she’s as eccentric <br />
and focused on her own path and delightful as ever— <br />
gave up being an architect, has been working almost full time <br />
on a complex art project related to the phenomenology <br />
of the origins of perspective, its relationship to Christian prayer <br />
and to the conceptualization of the world—she had a showing <br />
in St. Louis last year. The others you mention <br />
I’ve had no contact with…. Do you know how to contact <br />
Fred currently? Hugs and ciao, Tom”. <br />
Yes, that is indeed the voice of my cherished Tom, <br />
whom I can still see as if he were before me in the act— <br />
as simple and necessary as it was uncommon <br />
in the readiness with which it was done— <br />
of rising from where he was sitting in order to go <br />
sit down next to someone who wanted&nbsp;consoling.  </p>

<p>Fred, too, was quick, but more inclined to stroke <br />
the wrong way the hair of whoever spoke <br />
in clichés, automatic babble, and ready-made formulas <br />
from under an institutional umbrella, <br />
from behind a desk or atop a pulpit. <br />
It is unlikely that he had read much by Plato, <br />
yet the Socratic method was for him second nature <br />
and, in no time at all, the culprits <br />
could be found gagging with a foot <br />
in their mouth that they themselves had put. <br />
More than once suspended from school and oft dismissed <br />
from certain classrooms, whenever shown to the door <br />
my fast friend never failed to crawl out on all&nbsp;fours.  </p>

<p>He left high school before having quite finished <br />
and did not go to the most renowned university: <br />
it came to him, quite conversely, <br />
and the freshman both studied and taught mathematics <br />
there that same year. I have it from a reliable source <br />
that the richest man in the world took his course <br />
and that it helped him to become more&nbsp;pragmatic.  </p>

<p>The so-named educational method and philosophy <br />
that had come into being in those same lofty <br />
halls exactly one hundred years earlier, <br />
first enounced by Charles Sanders Peirce and then duly <br />
expanded upon and divulged by John Dewey <br />
(who died, incidentally, the same year <br />
in which Fred was born), may well have lived <br />
its apotheosis in that down-to-earth class of his. <br />
The lot of the nation’s upwardly-mobile reserves <br />
stormed shortly thereafter the ivory ramparts <br />
of higher learning (it was the time those serial upstarts <br />
known as “Yuppies” first made their sad presence observed); <br />
and authentic pragmatists, who always have the greater picture <br />
on their flesh-and-blood mind as a permanent fixture, <br />
were inevitably destined—just like Peirce himself generations <br />
earlier—to withdraw from the very stage they had helped to&nbsp;set.  </p>

<p>Society can only ever pay but lip service to the debt <br />
that it owes to the most daring imaginations: <br />
for it takes not only brains but also a heart to understand <br />
that the most audacious mind-sets achieved by Man <br />
require not just creativity but also the courage to use it. <br />
All those who really have neither, or perhaps one but not <br />
the other, must make the best of what they _have _got <br />
and band up so as to try to protect their allotted bits. <br />
Amongst them there may always be some <br />
who are still able to appreciate at least one <br />
(or the other) of those outstanding qualities, <br />
but never once anyone who can comprehend both. <br />
Inexorably lost upon those who are loath <br />
to admit to a broader scenario, audacity <br />
thus runs into society’s wall of defenses; <br />
if Fortune does not entirely omit to attend <br />
to its responsibility in the inevitable crash <br />
of the designated victims, the latter can usually hope <br />
to come out of it with a few broken bones, <br />
a solitary existence, and a shortage of cash: <br />
many a genial life’s tale in a single&nbsp;paragraph.  </p>

<p>One should hardly speak in terms of last laughs <br />
where such unhappy (when not downright tragic) <br />
turns of fate are concerned, but there remains the uncanny <br />
whole other side of the story that, one can be <br />
charmed to imagine, might simply condemn as if by magic <br />
all hypocrites to forever wash dishes in heaven. <br />
I advance this in lieu of other hypotheses more leaden, <br />
which posit instead afterlives of psycho-physical torment <br />
or—what is utterly inconceivable—a nothing <br />
devoid of all meaning, like turkey without gravy or stuffing, <br />
a state undistinguishable from never having been born. <br />
Everything is possible, of course, but my own impression <br />
is that human experience <em>does</em> assume superhuman dimensions <br />
wherein the scullery might well correspond to high&nbsp;office.  </p>

<p>I shall return upon this subject later, <br />
when the time comes to explore the great crater— <br />
or embarrassing, pustulant stumbling block <br />
on the plain face of our so-called mass culture— <br />
represented by the furuncular feature- <br />
length film that Fred and I made together, <br />
along with three more of my maverick brothers, <br />
and which goes by the title of “The Insignificant Other”. <br />
For the moment, I must abide by the taut tether <br />
of our greater community and go on to recount <br />
also a little of what Kerry and Scott are&nbsp;about.</p>
