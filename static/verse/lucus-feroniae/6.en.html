<p>Of our golden section’s original pentacle <br />
which I am here sketching, only one vertex, <em>id est</em> Scott, <br />
has produced offspring—a fact even more odd <br />
if one considers that he alone is of the same gender <br />
and mind when it comes to sexual preference. <br />
We all have had for sex a deep reverence, <br />
our facial wrinkles and puckers will attest to it; <br />
and, as is no doubt only normal, we all <br />
would also have loved to have kids one could call <br />
one’s own in the biological sense, fate permitting— <br />
but solely as a tribute to the rectilinear, as it were, <br />
not out of even the remotest bias against curves. <br />
The founding of a nuclear family seemed a worthy ambition, <br />
yet to adopt children was deemed an equally perfect, <br />
if perhaps more roundabout, way to effect it; <br />
plus, it had the honorable distinction <br />
of not contributing to the further augmentation <br />
of an already hypertrophic world population <br />
and, at the same time, of providing a home <br />
to those who might not otherwise have&nbsp;one.  </p>

<p>Tom, as we have seen, can claim to have done <br />
what our theory prescribed (and to have shown <br />
it to be entirely valid, one might add). <br />
But fate forbade even him to become a dad <br />
while still in the fullness of his prime, <br />
to take the straight path towards reproduction, <br />
yielding to the concerted efforts at abduction <br />
of mother nature and madam society combined. <br />
I think one might venture to say we grew certain <br />
that to possess even but half our genes would be a burden <br />
on the par with the next man’s or woman’s lot; <br />
and events concurred to prevent us from occasioning <br />
our reincarnation or compiling original sins— <br />
all of us except that walking experiment called&nbsp;Scott.  </p>

<p>To him I instead owe the perduring sensation— <br />
which first set in when, by way of recreation, <br />
we drove out together to remote shopping malls <br />
in the burbs, for to hold late-night conviviums <br />
over a sandwich and beer, a pack of smokes and one of gum— <br />
that everything can be explained if it is liable <br />
to explanation, that there exists a universal <br />
order, not only to things but also to words, <br />
in which even the social and “literary” criticism <br />
of two neophytes such as us occupied a central spot. <br />
It was a sensation that sprang out of thought <br />
which had struck and sustained a prose rhythm <br />
for the first time in conversation, analogous <br />
to the blissful feeling of riding the dragon <br />
that is experienced whenever the natural realm <br />
responds to one’s tottering advances towards it <br />
by propelling one forward as if on wings, <br />
whether as an athlete, skipper at the helm, <br />
artist, scientist, philosopher, animal-driven plougher <br />
of the land or of the body of a&nbsp;lover.  </p>

<p>Neither of us had been properly wounded yet, <br />
and each rested his hopes never to be so <br />
on the highest ideal he could reach by a bold <br />
leap of the imagination. Scott thus placed his bet <br />
that society would be induced to disown <br />
all political incorrectness also thanks to his own <br />
indefatigable efforts to promote therapy groups, <br />
tutoring, counseling, and psychoanalysis. <br />
I felt flattered to be a close pal of his, <br />
such dedication to others seemed to me a scoop <br />
worthy of the highest journalism, if not of literature: <br />
I, too, planned to devour my world in miniature <br />
but, having yet to be stung by the scorpion <br />
of politics, still lived entirely in the republic <br />
of ideas, where one could be thrust into the thick <br />
of battle while playing scales on an&nbsp;accordion.  </p>

<p>The greater part of my life has been spent <br />
keeping  tabs on all sorts of ugly conceits that entered <br />
my mind of their own accord, without there being anything <br />
I could do about the vile infiltrations except <br />
to take note of them with distaste and move on ahead. <br />
Everyday there were new ones, recrudescences notwithstanding, <br />
which I classified according to type: cowardly, evil, absurd— <br />
had they slipped by me unnoticed, I would have become a cur <br />
of uncommon proportions without realizing it. <br />
As it was, instead, I turned into an unwitting expert <br />
in the most recondite forms of vice on this Earth, <br />
to the extent—is there any reason to hide it?— <br />
of deeming the planet should be metaphysically a safer place <br />
once I were departed: another curious member of the race, <br />
you might say, who would have done better to be a&nbsp;plumber.  </p>

<p>As I recall, Scott’s insistence on the primary importance <br />
of admitting certain terms in lieu of others into our parlance <br />
(so as not to offend the sensibilities of a growing number <br />
of ethnic and social groups that advanced claims on the demotic) <br />
prompted not a few unwanted and unwarranted demonic <br />
parodies to be enacted on the stage of my conscience. <br />
In all fairness to my subconscious, however, <br />
it must be said that they were fair weather <br />
compared to the rabid version of common sense <br />
promulgated by some of those inquisitorial linguists. <br />
For how to imagine a more tense and constrictive <br />
environment than that circumscribed by the sphincters <br />
of someone who conceives of “significant other” <br />
as an improvement upon “darling”, or “love”, <br />
or any of the numberless names for him or for her <br />
with which, in a tongue known as English, forty <br />
generations of passionate speakers have invoked their abhorred <br />
cell-mate or beloved prison-keeper? There is nothing for it: <br />
the sensual and emotive deprivation of post-industrial <br />
Man is as pathetic and sad as it is ineluctable; <br />
lucky are they who still can enjoy a significant&nbsp;shit.  </p>

<p>Were I to lie down now on Scott the analyst’s couch <br />
and be enjoined to open my heart and to let it all out, <br />
to resume our old conversation where it got left off <br />
almost four decades ago, at the start of our life as adults, <br />
my impulse would be to try to sum up the results <br />
of my labors since then, to distil the slough of despond <br />
into whose tricky depths I have been drawn <em>pari passu</em> <br />
with the ebbing of hope that the world could improve. <br />
“The compassionate feeling that has led you to defend <br />
those who are oppressed”, I would tell him, “is one <br />
and the same as that kindled in me by traditional wisdom. <br />
To darn our fraying ties with the latter has hence <br />
been for me—and not only for me—a paramount duty, <br />
although I—we—could never have imagined how few <br />
and far between the so-called literate men and women <br />
would finally be who are not a part of the problem. <br />
As for the rest, I can neither condemn nor absolve them; <br />
it is a pity, however, that more people read not more poems, <br />
starting from the Bible, yet not disdaining yours&nbsp;truly.  </p>

<p>“I should be the first person to ridicule me <br />
for citing my own work and the seminal myths <br />
and metaphors of Western literature in the same breath, <br />
had I not a strange tale to get off my chest <br />
which I would now tell and pray you to bear&nbsp;with….”</p>
