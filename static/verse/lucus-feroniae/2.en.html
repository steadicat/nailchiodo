<p>Humanity and Nature have come to loggerheads <br />
and neither will be quite the same ever again. <br />
With hindsight, it is plain that both have “only kidded” <br />
until now, since even the briefest foresight bids us <br />
soon to expect a whole series of events Promethean, <br />
affecting the deepest traits of the race and its environment. <br />
How far away, indeed, are we from the requirement <br />
(for a more “cost-efficient” form of Earthly survival) <br />
of a grand genetic fusion between animal <br />
and vegetable, some sort of “little green man” <br />
made in the laboratory, in a prodigious vial— <br />
though, for ethical purposes, at first circumspectly— <br />
a chimera able to change light directly <br />
into something that, to itself, is partly edible? <br />
If Mohammed will not go to Mars, <br />
shall Mars not come to Mohammed? <br />
Would not a verdant pope be more credible <br />
when calling for peace from the window-sill? <br />
And if the corolla be Jewish, Goy at most the pistil, <br />
will God not preserve His chosen&nbsp;cabbage?  </p>

<p>It behooves not one who is frockless <br />
to pry into other people’s pockets <br />
and say where lies their advantage: <br />
that is Heaven’s part; our part <br />
to do those two things at once that enable Art <br />
to resist the tyranny of Nature, yet not succumb to Man’s— <br />
though no one has ever made any <em>money</em> <br />
at the festival, everyone has always <br />
given generously of their&nbsp;talent.  </p>

<p>That the pen is mightier than the sword <br />
has never been doubted by this author, <br />
although he has yet to find the right words <br />
to describe the mincemeat he would gladly have made <br />
of all those in his life who willfully got in the way <br />
(blades of <em>grass</em>, rather, seeming more suited to turds). <br />
But the rivers of ink that have flowed from our quills <br />
have not kept an ocean of blood from being spilled <br />
and a profession of modesty is no doubt in order: <br />
we came, we saw, we tried to conquer <br />
with all of our artistry the hearts of others; <br />
the hope was immense, the result mediocre. <br />
The sense of failure that has thus been our due <br />
comes as no surprise, finally, to those of us who <br />
have suffered intelligence to bow down to stupidity, <br />
not for a want of ability, or better arguments, <br />
or even of the chance to display them in parliament, <br />
but simply in deference to its sheer&nbsp;infinity.  </p>

<p>When caught in the midst of a swarm of locusts, <br />
one should not try to bring them too sharply into focus <br />
lest one leafily drop into a state of hypnosis <br />
that razes the spirit more than they do the crops. <br />
The same holds true as regards human props, <br />
though even among those who know this <br />
there is disagreement about them as such: <br />
what to one has become like a leg remains a crutch <br />
to another. Some claim there are none at all, <br />
while others maintain there is nothing but; <br />
between these extremes lies the actual rut <br />
in which one tries to plan one’s footfalls <br />
with blinders on to shut out the&nbsp;horror.  </p>

<p>One may rightly wonder what kind of honor <br />
there could possibly be in so grim a tale. <br />
That one has lived to tell it seems irrelevant <br />
by its very account; even an elephant’s <br />
memory would only lead back to this vale, <br />
however jungley and riddled be the way round. <br />
Ah, for a single clean piece to this world’s dying&nbsp;ground!  </p>

<p>The disordering of the senses, after it has lived <br />
(if it has lived) its systematic stage, <br />
becomes a semi-automatic quotidian rage <br />
that tends more towards the tan than to the livid. <br />
An inner ear attentive to the littlest thought <br />
remains all that is needed, more often than not, <br />
to immediately spot the dubious claim <br />
which would intrude from the hell of desire, <br />
to cast it back into the earthly mire <br />
where it can be certain to find heaven in&nbsp;pain.  </p>

<p>The true artist may enjoy some peace of mind, therefore, <br />
comforted not least by an anthropological metaphor: <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-levi-strauss" href="#fn-levi-strauss">no human community has ever tried to hold more <br />
than about <em>five-hundred</em> members and not split in two</a>. <br />
Here is a number that one might relate to <br />
even if one is not listed in <em>Fortune</em> or <em>Forbes</em>, <br />
an upper limit to the actual number of persons <br />
with whom one could hope to share the same version, <br />
<em>pace</em> the “twenty-thousand close friends” of President Ford. <br />
This glass ceiling, neither too low nor too tall, <br />
may, when the story is finished, be practically all <br />
that remains of infrangible to ward off the hordes <br />
from the inner sanctum of our personal lives. <br />
Without pleading misanthropy or telling a lie, <br />
one may set down terms and plant a few stakes <br />
in honor of that other ancient Roman divinity— <br />
the god Terminus, guardian of all true affinity— <br />
to mark off the borders of our private estate <br />
in the spirit, of a more proper property <br />
protected against the disarming robbery <br />
of meaning that proceeds unarrested at&nbsp;large.  </p>
