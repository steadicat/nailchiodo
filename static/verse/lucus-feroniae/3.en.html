<p>I shall therefore revert to the personal and the small <br />
and concentrate my attention only as far as the wall <br />
that separates my circle of intimates from others too ajar, <br />
too numerous, or too exclusive to be counted amongst us; <br />
I will do so starting from what one might call the “historic nucleus” <br />
of my closest friends and let the compass reach out from&nbsp;there.  </p>

<p>To cherish those nearest to one is a natural impulse— <br />
call it a passion, esprit-de-corps, or just instinctive pull— <br />
that not only gentlemen but also scoundrels do share: <br />
which may be one reason why Christ urged all those who can <br />
to go a step further and to try to understand, <br />
to bear with, and even to love them that inspire revulsion <br />
<em>prima facie</em>—a formidable imaginative task <br />
tantamount to the ripping off of the mask <br />
of the ego, the challenging of all convenient assumption, <br />
the begging to be torn asunder by the Furies … <br />
not exactly your every schlemiel’s cup of&nbsp;tea.  </p>

<p>Yet there are some whom the Fates have empowered <br />
to sense the primacy and urgency of such a proceeding, <br />
not only for themselves, but also for our whole species’ being: <br />
that it still might be said that we are not cowards <br />
before God as a race, though many continue to be craven, <br />
pusillanimous, and even dastardly towards their fellow&nbsp;man.  </p>

<p>So penitential a destiny can become sealed <br />
only after the “shades of the prison walls” have closed shut <br />
around the fully grown boy, not when his pluck <br />
is still adolescent and the rich penumbras of life’s appeal <br />
are but juvenescent. Yet it is at that earlier time— <br />
when the learning to read and to write on the fly <br />
and how to articulate individual opinions <br />
coincides with the pubescent’s natural need to rebel <br />
against their parents and/or other controllers, helps <br />
them to voice their aspirations despite all constriction— <br />
that young persons’ first vital, critical friendships are&nbsp;born.  </p>

<p>My own experience falls a little outside of the norm <br />
in this respect, as I sprang from a relatively enlightened couple, <br />
who had made life even easier for me by divorcing, <br />
so that I could have more or less my own way in things <br />
without offending anyone or causing much trouble. <br />
Also in deviance I was somewhat precocious, <br />
though to my mind there had been nothing atrocious <br />
in fixing a mirror to the top of my shoe <br />
and carrying out a detailed periscoscopy <br />
beneath a girl’s skirt, even if it got me <br />
failed in conduct while at elementary school. <br />
As far as rebellion is concerned, I have been convinced <br />
that the sooner it is enacted the better ever since <br />
I took a good look at my first-grade class picture: <br />
everyone in it except the hyperactive, most unruly <br />
kid—Steven I believe his name was—but including <br />
Mrs. So-and-so, our teacher, cuts a rather dull figure; <br />
Steven, instead, appears illumined by some vastly superior <br />
knowledge, his head at the center of the last row like a meteor <br />
beaming with a smile about to come down on us all. <br />
What happened to him in the later course of his life, <br />
I don’t know; that it may have ended in strife <br />
seems somehow probable, as sure as shooting stars fall; <br />
but, as far as I can distinguish, there is no <br />
spark of genius that does not have his&nbsp;glow.  </p>

<p>My first friends and I entered our teens in the mid-sixties, <br />
at a time when rebellion was very much in the air <br />
amongst those ten years older than us, who had been scared <br />
numb by the test-explosions of nukes on <span class="caps">TV</span>, <br />
the eeriness of the McCarthy hearings, the stomach-turning <br />
footage of concentration camps and of the ever-burning <br />
desert wastelands of Hiroshima and Nagasaki <br />
when they were coming of age and we were still toddlers. <br />
We, too, had perceived some of the same sodden <br />
stuff on the tube but, being much younger, were more lucky <br />
as far as the programming went, more in sync <br />
with the new plethora of slapstick <br />
and of comedies for children. We grew up on the whole <br />
formed by the sway of tongue-in-cheek portrayals <br />
of middle-class life, with hardly any wherewithal <br />
about the polemics that had surrounded, say, rock-and-roll; <br />
by the time we reached high school we were prone <br />
to believe ourselves bound to triumph by candor alone, <br />
and everything around us seemed to confirm&nbsp;it.  </p>

<p>Aristotle says that young persons fool themselves <br />
when they deem friendship not to be based upon selfish <br />
instinct, that in reality every relationship <br />
worthy of such a noble appellative is also an investment <br />
made to further concrete exchanges of mutual interest. <br />
I am quite ready to underwrite what old <em>Ipse</em> himself <br />
<em>dixit</em> in about as many words, as also my bosom buddies <br />
and myself in those halcyon days were not fudging <br />
around when we elected each other as the greatest wealth <br />
we could possibly want amidst the general scramble for treasure. <br />
All in our little “clique” had discovered the truest pleasure <br />
in the confirmation we afforded one another of the suspicion <br />
that had matured in each of us singly throughout the later years <br />
of our childhood, and in the “cross-fertilizations” we were <br />
able to enact for the enrichment of the others’&nbsp;visions.  </p>

<p>Despite our somewhat different backgrounds <br />
we had converged like so many hounds <br />
upon the same univocal conclusion: <br />
a more just world would have had to be meritocratic, <br />
what with most peers and adults being as <em>thick</em> <br />
as they were, like so many clots and occlusions <br />
to be preventively bypassed in society. <br />
The educational system recognized the propriety <br />
of desert as a criterion for advancement <br />
and, in this sense, appeared at least well-intentioned; <br />
yet it offered no follow-up in the same direction, <br />
preferring to prospect material enhancement <br />
to those who lagged behind intellectually. <br />
That this was a fatal flaw which eventually <br />
would precipitate the world’s descent into hell <br />
was quite beyond the scope of our imagination, <br />
as of most everyone else’s at the time in question: <br />
the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-the-limits" href="#fn-the-limits">“Limits of Growth”</a> were nice and well, <br />
but there was fuck-all one could do to avoid them; <br />
while nothing in the world waxed more annoying <br />
or wearing of the spirit than the sanctimonious <br />
bellowing of fatted calves to the&nbsp;slaughter.  </p>

<p>Tom, Fred, Kerry, and Scott were— <br />
I say this at the risk of sounding odious <br />
to someone who may never have had such a feeling— <br />
comrades who gave my adult life a reason for being <br />
beyond the confines of what is only better than nothing. <br />
Thanks to them I discovered the practical meaning <br />
of true nobility of character; of leaving <br />
the dumb, pedestrian trudge for the cutting- <br />
edge, tightrope dance of symbolic-logical <br />
thought; of the sublime supra-sexual <br />
in women; of an alerted social responsibility. <br />
Paltry things! Nothing more (or less) than the manifestation <br />
of what may be termed the divine in Man without exaggeration, <br />
the sodium chloride of all earthy&nbsp;sensibility.    </p>
