<p>Already two scores ago, a great many of my peers <br />
across the godless Atlantic, while still in their formative years <br />
felt spurred to abandon city or suburb and to return to the land <br />
in search of a different manner of life, inspired <br />
by an instinctive distaste for the waste that transpired <br />
from the pores of a body politic prey to consumption. <br />
Those “goddam, muthafuckin, hippie shits” <br />
(as local rednecks were wont to call the floral kids) <br />
were the first to feel the heat from a process of combustion <br />
that, precisely in those years, had reached a critical threshold: <br />
more energy was by then being produced bought and sold <br />
to fuel the world’s expanding industrial system <br />
than was photosynthesized by the plants of the earth <br />
and the waters. Man had outweighed the Sun in his worth. <br />
It was the beginning of a very particular&nbsp;end.  </p>

<p>In the wake of that epochal shifting of scales, <br />
the spoliation of the globe has progressed in full sail, <br />
or perhaps one should rather say at full steam; <br />
and even more tangible, by my estimation, <br />
than the overdoses of ultraviolet radiation <br />
that cut through the thinned air and find us at the beach <br />
is the knowledge or skin feeling, as you prefer, <br />
that also within our society there grows a desert, <br />
more arid yet than those that encroach from the tropics. <br />
But I shall not risk adding insult to injury in this poem <br />
or knocking down a door that is already wide open <br />
by trying to convince anyone of anything on this topic: <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-einstein" href="#fn-einstein">“Humanity in general will meet the fate it&nbsp;deserves.”</a>  </p>

<p>One still remains astonished, it needs be observed, <br />
that one’s own case but confirms the general rule: <br />
what a most extraordinary period of history to be living in, <br />
with a surprise, <em>man-made</em> apocalypse already in full swing <br />
as none of our God-fearing forefathers, except maybe Malthus, <br />
had even remotely imagined were humanly possible! <br />
Not exactly the sort of story it is at all probable <br />
that one shall tell to one’s grandchildren someday <br />
(“When I was your age, the world had just begun <br />
to go down the drain….”), nor a revelation <br />
to be easily shared with one’s contemporaries <br />
(“Layees and bent men, bow-wow, <br />
thank you, you can go home&nbsp;now….”).  </p>

<p>Because—it practically goes without saying— <br />
if it were not quite so difficult for us to communicate, <br />
we would not be in such straits in the first place. <br />
And this difficulty, too, is of our own making, <br />
albeit not the result of any conscious choice <br />
as of a confusion of the different voices <br />
that may speak to an individual but not to a nation, <br />
to a community but not to the world: <br />
what say the Partitions of Poland to a pretty girl? <br />
What the iniquity of&nbsp;overpopulation?  </p>

<p>Being the Beasts that we are, however, <br />
it is perhaps hardly a wonder <br />
if the vast majority of us, at least, <br />
have fallen prey to such equivocation: <br />
all that was at the origins of human creation— <br />
our ape-natural and cave-cultural ascendancies, <br />
the primordial terror that humbled the giants, <br />
the overwhelming prerogatives of families and clans, <br />
the primeval vow of the propertied to curtail their servants— <br />
all are still with us alongside the yearning for freedom; <br />
while the new type of colossus which we have become <br />
can no more be humbled than an army of ants <br />
or a mould grafted onto a half-loaf of&nbsp;bread.  </p>
