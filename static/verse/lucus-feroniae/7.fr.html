<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>&#8230; The animal I would most liken myself to is the sponge, <br />
for whatever else I may or may not have done <br />
in my day, I did suck-up every last drop <br />
of what appeared to be knowledge that floated my way. <br />
Philosophy thus grabbed and drew me in its sway, <br />
where portentous currents of old and new thought <br />
boldly carried me to and fro about the library. <br />
Except for proctology, which never quite did it for me, <br />
I read-up on every curious subject that I came across <br />
with an eye to filling-in the most serious lacunae <br />
in my education, the blind-spots in my world view. <br />
The more pieces I fit in, however, the more I was at a loss <br />
to believe how frightfully ignorant one can easily be, <br />
especially if one knows <em>how</em>, but not <em>what</em>, to actually&nbsp;read.  </p>

<p>“I have always felt akin to the underdog, and poetry, <br />
of all forms literary, is the most misapprehended: <br />
to be acquainted with it, it seems one must have attended <br />
a jesuitic academy or fallen-in with some coterie <br />
of initiates, for the good words do not lend themselves <br />
to being learnt by rote, between commanding bells; <br />
to penetrate a great poem is to enter a domain <br />
from which one emerges more true to oneself in the end. <br />
Moreover, poetry keeps alive the proclaiming voice even when <br />
it might seem there could be nothing left to proclaim. <br />
Self-dubbed cognoscenti and alleged intellectuals— <br />
who are fundamentally ignorant of it—are thus ineffectual <br />
also when it comes to reading the Bible intelligently: <br />
for they do no more, finally, than reject the same pseudo-literal <br />
interpretations of figures of speech that lead crude literalists <br />
straight off their rocker. What appears to follow inevitably <br />
from this is that one needs to have read modern verse <br />
in order to interpret ancient prophecy as it deserves, <br />
or simply so as not to be somehow <em>misled</em> by&nbsp;it.  </p>

<p>“To have had the fortune to read poems and understand <br />
their deeper meanings, in any event, is a great advantage. <br />
One may even have unsheathed the pen and written <br />
a few in one’s youth, or occasionally tried one’s hand <br />
at an imitation or two, without requiring an ambulance. <br />
But to envisage writing them as an adult <em>occupation</em>— <br />
if one has had any choice in the matter at all— <br />
is a dangerous sign of delusion, which should prompt one to call <br />
for the straightjacket immediately, without procrastination. <br />
The medieval minstrel’s complaint <em>‘carmine non dant panem’</em>— <br />
‘song does not give bread’—is as true today as it was then, <br />
and there is a secret reason why that is the&nbsp;case.  </p>

<p>“I have yet to meet someone who did not already know it: <br />
it is practically impossible to make a living as a poet— <br />
a fact which bespeaks of the very particular place <br />
the art occupies in both the culture and the society. <br />
Professions which enjoy such a negative notoriety <br />
are taboo amongst the general public. The bard’s <br />
is infamous also for being incomparably hard <br />
on the heart and mind of its practitioners, <br />
whose rate of suicide and mean life expectancy <br />
are rather higher and shorter, respectively, <br />
than those of other intellectual laborers. A dictionary— <br />
the ‘Poet’s Bible’ by definition—is, on this account, <br />
the single most dangerous book floating around: <br />
a record that might strike one as humorous <br />
since the wordbook is among the most ubiquitous <br />
of volumes, which aims to facilitate felicitous <br />
verbal expression, with applications varied and numerous <br />
and even children in grade school as habitual users. <br />
But the work of the poet, if he or she is not merely a boozer, <br />
is to struggle <em>against</em> the fascination that words exert upon one, <br />
to rend the compact representational fabric <br />
they incessantly weave, and to retrieve from the attic <br />
clues to the primal Mystery over which it is&nbsp;spun.  </p>

<p>“So now we come to my own scant experience <br />
in the realm of the deeply mysterious <br />
and near the strange, almost embarrassing, <br />
parts of my story. Of visions extraordinary, <br />
there have been several and of two categories. <br />
In the first were what one might call ‘parallax <br />
views’: projections of consciousness outside <br />
of my body and, by transposition, into the mind <br />
of persons who were in front of my eyes, <br />
whose thoughts I could either read clearly <br />
or, as circumstantial reasons led me to believe, <br />
were of a nature that could be safely surmised. <br />
I emphasize the empathic moment in the process <br />
because it is the sole common datum in my possession <br />
that describes the beginning, or catalysis, of what then <br />
took place, which participated largely of the&nbsp;divine.  </p>

<p>“Imagine feeling the steady progression of Time <br />
through every individual atom and every event <br />
without the immediate onset of chance distractions <br />
to turn the sensation awry and reduce to fractions <br />
what continues relentlessly to occur as a whole. <br />
Imagine, in effect, becoming tangibly one <br />
with the physical time-space continuum <br />
and intimations of the immortality of the soul <br />
surging to full dominion over all hesitation <br />
or doubt, on the strength of the concatenation <br />
of every phenomenon with every other. <br />
After the soul’s ecstatic perambulation (or the spirit’s, <br />
or the mind’s, as distinguos between them only get on one’s tits) <br />
came to an end at the swinging of the rudder, <br />
what one brought home with one was the indelible <br />
impression that everything that happens is inevitable, <br />
predetermined down to the minutest detail, <br />
and that an equipollent measure of critical acumen <br />
is necessarily the prerogative of but a very few men <br />
and women: notions whose heuristic value is nil, <br />
yet which, in themselves, formed a crowning&nbsp;achievement.  </p>

<p>“But what about pain, grief, bereavement, <br />
and the whole band of demons that foment <br />
all that is most execrable amongst us? <br />
The satoris described above subsumed the fuss <br />
they create in our lives, while the real torment <br />
they bring was grit for the teeth of the second <br />
category of apparitions with which I have reckoned. <br />
The latter are also the reason I have embarked <br />
upon this description of my deontological motives <br />
for writing in verse, which include a votive <br />
and witness-bearing impulse as a central&nbsp;part….”</p>
