<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>&#8230; Once, to my own stupefaction, I observed a devil <br />
abandon the body of a woman I shared a bed with, <br />
because it suffered not the unflinching kindness <br />
and patience with which I was countering <br />
the chronic condition of anger I had first found her in. <br />
I am reluctant to think it was mental blindness <br />
that kept her from noting the horned chimera <br />
that escaped from her bosom: there is no camera <br />
which could have recorded the image I recognized <br />
as being of rage incarnate, and it would be <br />
an understatement to say I myself could hardly <br />
believe the monster I had unwittingly exorcized; <br />
yet, as sure as she then let out a great sigh <br />
of relief, it is certain that I, at least, clearly saw&nbsp;why!  </p>

<p>“On another occasion, a personification of laziness <br />
more horrid than sheer fantasy could have devised <br />
appeared as if on a stage in front of my eyes <br />
for my private scrutiny, to my utter amazement: <br />
a square-jawed crone, ragged, disheveled, <br />
the very portrait of Sloth at home in Hell; <br />
it sat there hunchbacked upon a small stool <br />
ranting, whining willful infirmity, <br />
repeating incessantly and for all eternity <br />
its refusal to do anything or even to move. <br />
The faceless impresario who had set up the show <br />
must have been determined that I should not disown <br />
or put into question the reality of my vision <br />
since, of a sudden, rays of coherent green light <br />
shot straight out of my eyes and landed right <br />
upon the pitiful figure, that it might be pinned on <br />
my conscience for the rest of my&nbsp;days.  </p>

<p>“The godhead—or whatever which way <br />
you want to call the overpowering entity <br />
that presides over such paranormal <br />
activity in the brain—affixes moral <br />
responsibility as a mark of identity. <br />
It was Christ in person, according to Swedenborg, <br />
who told him to stay away from the smorgasbord <br />
and opened his season of divination galore. <br />
Though my credibility be bound to suffer <br />
amongst the atheists who have heard me thus far, <br />
I too must claim to have perhaps seen Our Lord, <br />
if only in profile and silhouetted. <br />
Tall, thin, erect, with a hooked <br />
nose and in a long cape, He pointed <br />
to a round mark on the ground near His feet <br />
(not unlike the spots at Saint Pete’s where Bernini’s <br />
colonnades all radiate from and conjoin) <br />
while these words came to me as if telepathically: <br />
‘This is the place from which all things seem sad.’ <br />
My immediate, instinctive reaction was to step <br />
back, away from that nerve-center of gloom; <br />
and, in an instant, I was again safe in my room, <br />
alone but for the bee that had been put in my&nbsp;bonnet.  </p>

<p>“There was something peerless in the Shadow’s demeanor <br />
that led me to believe it was Him I had seen, <br />
just as the sentence that had been enounced <br />
was charged with a unique authority; <br />
the aquiline trait brought to mind the Florentine <br />
forefather of all poets visionary, but I found <br />
no reason in my heart to doubt it was Jesus. <br />
Similarly, when I eventually took out a new lease <br />
on life and traced my way back to that pole <br />
of dismay, I discovered that it displayed no more <br />
and no less than the whole human race run ashore, <br />
dead as nails as it were, with myself as the sole <br />
live witness left at the fatal end of its story; <br />
then, in my arms, it was His body I did&nbsp;hold.  </p>

<p>“One last episode and I shall have taken full stock <br />
of my netherworld inventory as it now stands: <br />
once, when I had been left to gather the strands <br />
of an nth shattered hope, I perceived van Gogh’s <br />
painting as I had never before or ever have since; <br />
the pity encrypted therein caused me to wince <br />
and to envisage, for a brief moment, what I gather <br />
everyone might see when they finally meet up <br />
with their Maker. It may seem like a storm in a tea cup <br />
compared to the venerable archetypes on the matter, <br />
because it involves but a single figurant, <br />
who was under the spotlight for only a few instants; <br />
yet, the quick appearance sufficed to convince me <br />
of some of my own psyche’s fundamental convictions. <br />
The figure—solitary and without other constrictions <br />
than a white robe and a tragic mask of ancient Greek <br />
inspiration—stands forth suddenly from behind <br />
a shifting curtain of clouds of the cumulous kind; <br />
it lets out a scream (of which I catch what sounds <br />
like just the beginning) in an unheard-of register, <br />
well beyond the compass of what can be considered <br />
normally audible by human ears. Outside the bounds <br />
of Earthly expectation in high pitch and volume, <br />
it turns all bodily frame into fully dissoluble, <br />
friable substance, scathed to pure naught <br />
in fast-flying seconds by a wrathful wind <br />
that the cry engenders; while minds get the full drift <br />
of the agony and horror with which it is fraught. <br />
Abomination that has been kept pent <br />
since the immemorial origin of moral sentiment <br />
invests in equal measure all those who stand before it, <br />
reduces them to small heaps like cottage cheese <br />
before they can even fall to their knees. <br />
If I am right, prospects are not exactly florid; <br />
but for all to whom ostentation in life caused disgust, <br />
the one consolation shall be the voice is&nbsp;Just.    </p>
