<h1>Canto&nbsp;<span class="caps">XI</span></h1>



<p>Left alone yet again to his own vices and devices <br />
(And wizened to the fact that modern love <br />
Smiles only upon them that specializes), <br />
Lud decided to stay on the market in case anyone <br />
Particular still required his special offices. <br />
By way of promotion he went galavanting, <br />
Spent a vintage year making passes in passing, <br />
Sliding behind curtains in the great metropolis <br />
To lend a hand to silken thighs, to labia a kiss. <br />
Yet, for all the healthy sweating and panting, <br />
Closer scrutiny refused to induce further promise. <br />
Just as misogyny is a social disease, <br />
Philogyny is a form of social therapy, <br />
One whose successes and failures <br />
Can only be measured concretely, <br />
In the manner of those of the medical sciences; <br />
The origin of the “pathologies” it is concerned with <br />
Never lies in the women who are the object of empathy <br />
But always in the relation of the latter to myth, <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-the-basic" href="#fn-the-basic">The basic functional unit of human society</a>; <br />
And it is always the myth that choses the man, finally, <br />
Not vice versa. (<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-here-again" href="#fn-here-again">Here again we begin to see <br />
How one may feel pain in the body of another person</a> <br />
And the headache that can be hid in a pretty face.) <br />
Forced thus to proceed on a more subtle pretence, <br />
To try to flush out a tale hungry enough for him, <br />
Lud withdrew from the scene, myth trailing near. <br />
A century-old paradigm then earned our allegiance: <br />
Never was there concert in the western hemisphere <br />
As when a girl undertook a Jamesian mission. <br />
Jeanne Marie had come on the trail of Daisy Miller <br />
As upon the green ray of a setting Sun <br />
From <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-le-beau" href="#fn-le-beau"> <em>le beau pays sans merci</em></a> to the motherland <br />
Of evening; and Lud, who knew a Lady when he saw one, <br />
Was there to greet her as behooved the embassy. <br />
Jeannie was rather unique in her genre <br />
And in her attributes seemed almost to parody <br />
The type of the heroine in that classic story: <br />
She had all the accoutrements of the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-luxury-mam" href="#fn-luxury-mam">“luxury mammal”</a>— <br />
Patina of humanistic culture, body to outstrip <br />
Most any centre-fold, charm, savoir-faire— <br />
And she wasn’t even the daughter of a millionaire! <br />
Common influences seemed never to have got a grip <br />
On the lass, who appeared quasi impervious <br />
To traditional forms of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-intangible" href="#fn-intangible">intangible bondage, <br />
To any impinging of family pressure, <br />
Or of other personalities on her own</a>. <br />
She had in mind something more perilous &#8230; <br />
Would call reality’s bluff at her leisure &#8230; <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-and-painti" href="#fn-and-painti">And paint—in a form of narrative poetry</a>— <br />
Probative pictures of the life she was shown. <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-ever-since" href="#fn-ever-since">Ever since Michelangelo single-handedly <br />
Placed God at Man’s finger tip</a>, hubris of this sort <br />
Has been the staple spiritual resource <br />
Of all true lovers, philosophers, and artists, <br />
Of all those, that is, who in their daily lives <br />
Exercise a creative awareness. <br />
The other condition of such proclivity, of course, <br />
Is constant application and the leviathan patience <br />
That it entails—a quality Jeanne Marie <br />
Possessed as well, but in no mean measure <br />
Also demanded: the filly, in fact, had quite a temper <br />
And Lud had to be a bit of a filly-buster <br />
Just to get off the ground with her. <br />
It was not long, however, before the two embarked <br />
On what was to become a seven-year <em>tour de force</em> <br />
That spanned the Atlantic and took stark <br />
Census of Occidental sensibility. <br />
Once, while strolling casually close to the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-mouth" href="#fn-mouth">Mouth <br />
Of Truth</a> enlaced in each other’s arms, <br />
The Sun cast their shadow on the ground <br />
In such a way as made them seem like one <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-rough" href="#fn-rough">rough <br />
Beast out of <em>Spiritus Mundi</em>, with the mane <br />
And body of a lion, the profile of a man, <br />
That moved its slow thighs</a> and appeared to yeast <br />
At the eyes and mouth for Truth and Judgement. <br />
If they had seen—I don’t know—<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-a-duckie" href="#fn-a-duckie">a duckie <br />
Or a horsie</a>, it would have been more in keeping <br />
With the mentality hegemonic in those decades; <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-but-the-mi" href="#fn-but-the-mi">But the miseries of the west were misery <br />
To them, and precluded the restful glade. <br />
Strain of Truth and Judgement proved <br />
Upon the pulses</a> grew unbearable <br />
In the end: questions ethical and of etiquette <br />
Invaded bedroom, bathroom and kitchenette; <br />
Antipodal conceptions of womanhood <br />
And fatherhood, of motherhood <br />
And manhood, stole the shew from the daily <br />
Brood, made mockery of all attempt <br />
At dialogue and claim to reason. <br />
Whether it was the Beast, finally, that tore <br />
The two asunder, or they who quartered it, <br />
Is implicitly impossible to know. To be sure, <br />
Lud felt compelled to carry out a radical <br />
Thought auto-lobotomy experiment; <br />
While Jeanne Marie went east, to seek <br />
The <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-sunya" href="#fn-sunya"> <em>sunya</em></a> whence all things spring— <br />
The result being that he became a liberal, <br />
She a <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-master-of" href="#fn-master-of">master of that suppleness <br />
So particular to dry lacquer technique</a>.  </p>
