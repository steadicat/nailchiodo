<h1>Canto&nbsp;<span class="caps">XII</span></h1>



<p>All who have seen the Gorgon know <br />
The value of simple pleasures—are <br />
Pledged to protect the Spirit’s cause <br />
From ideological peroration; to <br />
Uphold the primacy of the individual <br />
Over and—when need be—against the social: <br />
For the pain of whoever sees the Gorgon <br />
Is greater than that of the whole world. <br />
In the wake of his thought auto-lobotomy <br />
Experiment—<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-which-had" href="#fn-which-had">which had not been an experiment <br />
At all, of course, but, at bottom, <br />
A grammatical investigation</a>—Lud <br />
Had a rather quixotic notion of when <br />
To keep silent and when, instead, to speak up <br />
For the greater peace of mind of us all. <br />
I myself cannot recall a single precedent <br />
In the entire <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-corpus" href="#fn-corpus"> <em>Corpus Rerum Hominum</em></a>— <br />
The little volume my angel colleagues and I <br />
Have been compiling over the ages—of the type <br />
Of row he had with Jan, at the climax <br />
Of their brief but intense relation. <br />
Never before had so abstruse a quip <br />
Undone the idyll between two lovers, <br />
And yet all concurs to suggest that it <br />
Was quite literally written in the stars! <br />
She did the prompting, provided the cue <br />
Which set his objections in motion— <br />
To which she retorted such steadfast “Adieu” <br />
It was plain they had caused a commotion. <br />
In the room, <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-prufrock" href="#fn-prufrock">Prufrock’s women come and go <br />
And it is that they talk of Michelangelo</a> <br />
Which is significant, not what they say about him; <br />
In the case of Jan, instead, what irked Lud <br />
Were, not just the <em>manner</em>, but also the <em>tone</em> <br />
With which she brought up Quantum Theory <br />
In the parlour: light and cheerful as was her wont, <br />
They made him, of a sudden, ever so weary— <br />
As if the microscopic structure of the Universe <br />
Had become a frill of the <em>status quo</em>. <br />
A word of explanation might here be in order. <br />
The physicists had almost pinpointed it in the laboratory <br />
And a few even put their finger on it on paper: <br />
There was no point in trying to find out the <em>whole</em> score <br />
About the Universe, when it was in part oneself <br />
Was writing it—unless, of course, one wished <br />
To know the <em>whole</em> score on oneself as well. <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-servants" href="#fn-servants">One’s servants might have someday done <br />
The living for one</a>, but, until then, quantum <br />
Discontinuity begged acquiescence to the <em>centrality</em> <br />
Of Man—who, as <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-von-weizsc" href="#fn-von-weizsc">von Weizsäcker</a> once said, <br />
Came after Nature, but before Natural Science. <br />
Now, when one talks of quanta one speaks <br />
Of things which—though of great pitch and moment— <br />
Are, in size, as small as can be: the rapport <br />
Between the limits they pose to Knowledge <br />
And the common <em>Homo sapiens’</em>  life on Earth <br />
Appears, to all effects, exiguous. <br />
But one nevertheless exists! The same common sense <br />
That formed the basis of the first physics <br />
And will last down to the last description <br />
Tells one so. So it was not without being <br />
A party to the case that our <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-cato" href="#fn-cato">Cato the Censor</a> <br />
Advised against such assumptions <br />
As Jan—apple of his eye!—was making. <br />
In his view, she had touched upon a point <br />
That concerned all human beings equally <br />
In a style which seemed rather more informed <br />
By her own sex’s centrality <em>within</em> the species. <br />
What neither could actually perceive until <br />
All hell had once again been coralled <br />
Into separate pastures, was that Jan <br />
Was already with child in the imagination, <br />
Whereas for Lud the game of life had ceased— <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-ceteris" href="#fn-ceteris"> <em>Ceteris paribus</em></a>—to be worth the candle. <br />
She soon conceived, in fact, a delightful offspring <br />
With the most eligible drone around, <br />
While Lud calmly resigned himself to being <br />
Less likely to procreate than a&nbsp;priest.  </p>
