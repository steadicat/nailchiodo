<h1>Canto <span class="caps">X</span></h1>



<p>The time was overripe, long gone to seed, <br />
For Time to be called “Destroyer” to its face: <br />
More than Lud ever hoped for or dreamed <br />
Had been tendered him on a golden plate <br />
Only to be promptly cleared away and forthwith replaced <br />
With other rare morsels of blending taste <br />
Lent him new charge—till, in the end, he could but scream <br />
“O God—enough of love—I am satiate!” <br />
To retire at thirty (having made millions of bucks) <br />
Had been the dream of peasants in his generation; <br />
To do so (still penniless but) after thousands of fucks <br />
Was more in line with the aristocratic station <br />
Will not add to mankind’s <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-cahiers" href="#fn-cahiers"> <em>cahiers de doléances</em></a>. <br />
So it was that Lud honestly came to believe <br />
He could do without yet another good woman, <br />
Live henceforth in a virile spirit of chastity <br />
And come to terms (finally) with his own <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-soliton" href="#fn-soliton">soliton</a>. <br />
Which indeed is the way it might all have worked out <br />
Had it not been for the wild type of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-kants-impe" href="#fn-kants-impe">Kant’s imperative</a>, <br />
With all of its totally and in no way gratuitous clout, <br />
Which placidly suggested that a soul found attractive, <br />
And patently in need of attention, should not— <br />
If at all possibile—be left unattended: <br />
With Lesley, as with most any girl seen by chance at a party, <br />
That meant hitting the dance floor and singling her out. <br />
And that is, in fact, what Lud proceeded to do <br />
With the zen-like precision of one who has nothing to gain <br />
And nothing to lose; for he did not, most assuredly, <br />
Have her in mind for <em>himself</em> when he made his move. <br />
Our young Casanova plans on pimping for friends, <br />
To keep busy after early retirement; <br />
The idea leaps at him, spurred by the moment: <br />
A way not to waste the expertise he’s acquired <br />
In luring and baiting curious specimens; <br />
An ethical human-resource investment; <br />
A novel sort of spiritual militancy even, <br />
As a politically-correct Saviour might have ordained <br />
Somewhere along the lines of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-follow-me" href="#fn-follow-me">“Follow me <br />
And I’ll make you a fisher of <em>women</em>.”</a> <br />
While he and Lesley boogied away, <br />
Lud worked out the whole deontology; <br />
The morrow was to be just another day <br />
In which he would turn her over to Charly; <br />
And at close of evening, in front of her doorstep, <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-fortiori" href="#fn-fortiori"> <em>A fortiori</em></a> no kiss was exchanged. <br />
The sincerity of our self-styled match-maker <br />
Can hardly be matter for doubt; <br />
But one can’t really blame Charly either <br />
For wondering what Lud’s plan was about: <br />
A merchant by trade and formation, <br />
He was naturally suspicious of any donation, <br />
Especially if it consisted in a young lady <br />
Hot as plutonium, but perhaps just as shady. <br />
So he forewent trying his chances with her, <br />
Left his pal Lud to enjoy his <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-droit" href="#fn-droit"> <em>droit du seigneur</em></a> <br />
And manage his own portfolio of futures. <br />
That Lud thence returned upon his decision <br />
Never again to get amorous with someone <br />
And, overcome by compassion <br />
For his rejected offering, <br />
Fell for Lesley like a plump persimmon <br />
In no way means he had succumbed <br />
To exhuming old velleities and expectations: <br />
Henceforth he might still love, yes, but all the while <br />
Expecting nothing in return; it would take patience <br />
Perseverance selfless dedication, a style <br />
Almost imperceptible because utterly uncommon, <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-paradoxical" href="#fn-paradoxical">Paradoxical fulfillment of the self-images <br />
Of the age</a>. That the time had come to be less wanton <br />
Was also a matter of simple arithmetic, <br />
Really, though of a beauty so intrinsic <br />
As to solve a whole variety of conundrums. <br />
To&nbsp;wit:  </p>

<blockquote>
1 / 7 = 0 . <span class="overline">1 4 2 8 5 7</span><br/>
2 / 7 = 0 . <span class="overline">2 8 5 7 1 4</span><br/>
3 / 7 = 0 . <span class="overline">4 2 8 5 7 1</span><br/>
4 / 7 = 0 . <span class="overline">5 7 1 4 2 8</span><br/>

6 / 7 = 0 . <span class="overline">8 5 7 1 4 2</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<p>—a series of homologous, infinite expansions <br />
(Known as <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-sukumar" href="#fn-sukumar">Sukumar’s Symphony of Numbers</a> <br />
After the gentle avatar who composed it) <br />
Which discompose the veil of the seventh digit <br />
Just that bit that’s needed to reveal its wonders. <br />
Point is, Lesley became Lud’s seventh lover <br />
And, as these playful figures prove, <br />
Harmony will be inherent in a heart that’s true <br />
When it gets divided into seven parts. <br />
With her, Lud reached his seventh heaven; <br />
Their love was perfected, if e’er love has been. <br />
But after only a few months in which he <br />
Had showered her with all manner of attention, <br />
Lesley came down with an itch to move on <br />
And pursue her own prurient vocation. <br />
Lud, too, felt a plummeting tension, <br />
A surging sense of futility and ennui— <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-not-unlike" href="#fn-not-unlike">Not unlike that of God the seventh day of creation</a>. <br />
After taking her leave of him with due reverence, <br />
She promptly forded the shallows of prescience <br />
And soused in the find that she was the kind <br />
Of person who is of like gender and mind <br />
In questions of sexual preference. <br />
Soon she became a gallant natural force, <br />
Defender of the oppressed and a terror in the Courts; <br />
And Lud could not but feel proud in the end, <br />
As he had been her lover, that he still was her&nbsp;friend.  </p>
