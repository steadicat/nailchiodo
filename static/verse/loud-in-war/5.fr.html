<p>Perhaps because he was a total sucker for disinhibition, <br />
Perhaps because he was in part Italian, <br />
Ethics of the tale, Lud knew he had to see Becky <br />
With his own eyes before taking any further step <br />
In his liberal arts education. She must have come <br />
From one of those upper-middle-class, suburban <br />
Think-tank households, where the American dream’s <br />
Highest reveries got achieved in a silence <br />
Broken only by classical music and the sound <br />
Of washing machines: remarkable, though, was not the fact <br />
She had been taking the pill since she was fourteen <br />
As that she still sucked her thumb at twenty. <br />
While one of her hands might thus have been busy <br />
Suckling the kid like a teat, just as easily <br />
The other slapped leather, brandished paper and pen, <br />
And performed some logical feat. Of their conversation, <br />
What comes back to mind is this excerpt. Our friend <br />
(Insisting on the sole tack he knew and, <br />
For good or for evil, could never abandon): <br />
“Yes, but what about Philosophy, what about Plato?!” <br />
“Plato’s <em><span class="caps">OK</span></em>, but he’s not <em>spectacular</em>.” <br />
“What, then, <em>is</em> ‘spectacular’ according to you?!!” <br />
“A <em>good</em> piece of fiction <em>can</em> be <em>spectacular</em>.” <br />
Though he did not at all agree with them, <br />
Her answers nevertheless agreed with him, <br />
Left his mouth more shut than open. <br />
Who had ever heard a vernacular <br />
Of such an exquisitely philosophic kind, <br />
Except perhaps the happy few, in the good old days <br />
Of Bloomsbury, who had got it straight <br />
From Wittgenstein? I will linger just enough <br />
In these circles to add that Becky even matched <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-sraffa" href="#fn-sraffa">Sraffa— <br />
In terms of know-how—when she gave one the finger</a>. <br />
What, I ask myself, did Lud learn from her? <br />
I believe it was something he already sensed <br />
But might never have accepted otherwise: <br />
From this sparrow in command of the skies <br />
Whom no amount of adoration could stop <br />
He learned that he was oppressive <br />
And had no choice but either to find out how not <br />
To be so, or to die. Whether he did in the end, <br />
The rest may, I hope, help the ladies&nbsp;decide.  </p>
