<p>The three Graces just spoken of had escorted Lud <br />
Into that privileged world opens up to one <br />
Who has been weaned on the nectar of Empire <br />
And cardinal forms of Earthly love. <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-the-prince" href="#fn-the-prince">The princely pedestal evinced by Stendhal <br />
To be the one prerequisite essential <br />
To Beauty if it is to engage the heart</a> <br />
Had thus, by God’s will, been assured him: <br />
Our lover, with his twice-broken pump <br />
And at least one crumpled ball, <br />
Became choice prey for the Goddess at large. <br />
A citizen of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-a-city-ren" href="#fn-a-city-ren">a city renowned <br />
For making artists feel welcome</a>, <br />
Véra had seen Lud’s passing through town <br />
As a good opportunity if ever there was one <br />
To uphold tradition and let fall her gown. <br />
Out of nowhere she’d come <br />
At the risk of being despised, <br />
Disrobed and laid down her pride <br />
In exchange for a greater one. <br />
Magical spectacles ground from the purest Olympian crystal <br />
Are what I’ll now fashion, fair reader, <br />
That you may see through the mask of the couple <br />
And grasp the terms of their barter. <br />
Aside from her ration of perturbing good looks, <br />
Véra had but limited assets to boast of: <br />
A possible language degree, a few books, <br />
The sort of stuff went then into fodder. <br />
Like most of the shrapnel from the great Baby Boom, <br />
She had picked-up pell-mell her notions of order; <br />
The primordial soup she’d dipped her tin spoon in <br />
Had let off of wealth the rancid odour; <br />
And observing its dregs now, in her own shallow dish, <br />
She divined the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-true-natur" href="#fn-true-natur">true nature of love in the wish <br />
Of Poverty to catch the imagination of Cunning</a>. <br />
Lud, for his part, now at last in the running, <br />
Strutted about, the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-weltgeist" href="#fn-weltgeist"><em>Weltgeist</em></a> in his boxers. <br />
He thought of Alexander, <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-all-of-who" href="#fn-all-of-who">all of whose friends <br />
Had also gone by that name</a>, and of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-caesar" href="#fn-caesar">Caesar, <br />
Who had sat down and wept when he reached Lud’s same age <br />
Because he hadn’t yet shone like the former</a>. <br />
He thought of his own plans for the future, <br />
Felt daring flow warm in the vein, <br />
Decided he would ask Véra to follow him: <br />
With such a classic <em>Parisienne</em> in his train, <br />
Back from his Junior Year Abroad, at his Ivy League School, <br />
He would be greeted as no ordinary fool&#8230;. <br />
Like a Degree from the Outside World <em>summa cum laude</em>, <br />
She might even open doors for him in the Ivory Tower! <br />
While her integrity intellectual would obligingly bring <br />
A royal taste to the proof in the pudding. <br />
Plainly, the man was “cooked”, as one says in the popular jargon: <br />
Love’s culinary miracle had, once again, been accomplished. <br />
I must give vent here to both a smile and a tear <br />
Given what Junior’s year held in store, rather, <br />
After Véra disappeared, all hope suddenly shattered, <br />
And Reason itself only got off with a suture. <br />
She had left him, ostensibly to go back to an old suitor, <br />
Because Lud—so she explained—was too young and certain to tire <br />
Of her before long. The free agent in love, <br />
Who spares nothing and no one to attend to life’s vaster designs, <br />
Yet again had called in and left his card on our door. <br />
But something fundamental had nonetheless changed <br />
In the Divine economy of the world: philosophers <br />
Would be wise to assay some day the stone <br />
Ludwig had discovered; for under the weight <br />
Of his footsteps forlorn, the mica in sidewalks <br />
Had become far more precious than&nbsp;gold.  </p>
