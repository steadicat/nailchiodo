<h1>Invitation to a Seance Around the Banquet&nbsp;Table</h1>



<p>Were I to have the privilege of your company <br />
for a <em>tête à tête</em> at my home some evening, Bob Dylan, <br />
I would first offer you what, in my opinion, <br />
is the best place to sit; then, if there were anything <br />
else hopefully to your liking that I could purvey, <br />
I would do my best to do so. <em>Then</em> <br />
I&#8217;d shut up, treat you as a monarch of sorts, <br />
one whom one doesn&#8217;t speak to unless addressed. <br />
Were you to be, before close of eve – <br />
which you may wish to cut short! – so gracious <br />
as to prompt a consideration from me <br />
on any matter I – your subject of sorts – imagine <br />
could be of common interest to us, <br />
I might hazard the following question: <br />
“I was wondering whether you would accept <br />
the Nobel in Literature were it to be – finally, <br />
as many would be sure to say – awarded to you? <br />
Because I, too, would hardly disapprove <br />
were you to be accorded, for literature, the honor: <br />
I&#8217;d be sitting on the edge of my seat <br />
waiting to hear your Banquet Speech! <br />
But, even more unimaginable to my mind, <br />
is what you might say in your Nobel Lecture. <br />
My ears would be wide open then, <br />
as they no doubt would be across the globe. <br />
Would you talk at length, in a prose rhythm? <br />
Any idea of the tack you might take?!” <br />
That, dear Bob Dylan, is what I would ask you. <br />
(Plainly, I do not presume to divine your reply. <br />
I couldn&#8217;t possibly put words in your mouth. <br />
Though I&#8217;d be a hypocrite if I didn&#8217;t admit <br />
I&#8217;d get a crack out of hearing, in royal Hick, <br />
“I ain&#8217;t here to lecture no one about&nbsp;nothin&#8217;.”)  </p>
