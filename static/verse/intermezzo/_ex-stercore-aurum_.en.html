<h1><em>Ex Stercore&nbsp;Aurum</em></h1>



<p>So let us sing our Era&#8217;s praises <br />
and pluck the eyebrows that it raises <br />
among those who still think it sufficient <br />
to be the age&#8217;s dirty conscience. <br />
The latter falls indeed under our competence <br />
as poets and critics of the human predicament; <br />
but what about that which is positive in it? <br />
I dare say it runs by far the worst risk, <br />
that of not being sung about at all, <br />
given the tenor of contemporary&nbsp;lyric.    </p>

<p>Yet there is still enough food for the spirit, <br />
sustenance for to stay on the ball, <br />
thanks to a few die-hard men and women <br />
who put on a good show every now and again; <br />
and to that giant cesspool the internet, <br />
that <em>Cloaca Maxima</em> of digital excrement, <br />
Humanity&#8217;s “all bowel movement spent,” <br />
in which the imagination sets the limit <br />
to the amount of gold at one&#8217;s fingertips. <br />
Lives that are full are will-of-the-wisps <br />
since our reality is almost all simulacra; <br />
but if one is to believe what they used to say, <br />
we could not have borne very much&nbsp;anyway.    </p>

<p>One still can find ways to open the chakras, <br />
or means towards other ends that obtain <br />
though they go by less fanciful names; <br />
pay a visit to some far-off exotic place <br />
as a tourist before an Act of God <br />
or afterward as part of a relief squad; <br />
vanish forever without leaving a trace; <br />
take a quick tour in outer space, <br />
the wallet permitting. It still is the case <br />
that if one travels the world one wakes up <br />
but a dunce who sets out remains&nbsp;such.    </p>

<p>Never has it been simpler to get back in touch <br />
with friends and acquaintances an abrupt <br />
turn of events led one to lose track of. <br />
Never has it been easier to discover one&#8217;s past loves&#8217; <br />
whereabouts, <span class="caps">CV</span>, list of publications. <br />
Carry out a search on Google<sup>®</sup> or Yahoo<sup>®</sup> : <br />
one is bound to spot them amid the gobbledygook, <br />
ravaged by time, undiminished in the station <br />
they occupy in what is left of one&#8217;s&nbsp;heart.    </p>

<p>A passionate intensity is no longer our part <br />
but far be it from us to lack all conviction. <br />
Of all things extant the most precious, <br />
the rarest breed of enlightened consensus, <br />
casts the cold eye upon our condition. <br />
We must make do with a Harley instead of a horse <br />
to pass by on, but that&#8217;s par for the&nbsp;course.    </p>
