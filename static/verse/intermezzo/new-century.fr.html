<h1>The new&nbsp;century</h1>



<p>The new century is wearing in like a shoe, <br />
all the tunes in the news are familiar: <br />
compliments of well over one billion <br />
grandsons and daughters of toil who eschewed <br />
the satanic mill and cloddish plot <br />
in favor of more genteel, white-collar jobs. <br />
Having fulfilled at last their dream of living <br />
in file-cabinetlike, digitalized cities, <br />
they obviously now value stability— <br />
of life, of standards—above all other things. <br />
And a  rock-bottom stability—“centipedal” in quality— <br />
has steadily crept into every nook in the polities <br />
to the sum of their aureate&nbsp;mediocrity.    </p>

<p>In full control of every possible sector, <br />
they exercise also the function of censors <br />
within the various mediocracies: <br />
only sanitized, cliché-ridden accounts <br />
of harsher realities go the rounds <br />
of general publics either naïve or complicit. <br />
We are told little and shown even less <br />
of the other five-sixths who are propertyless <br />
or almost so, and if by some twist <br />
we do catch a glimpse of the horror <br />
that lurks just outside our door, <br />
we are morally shattered and ready for&nbsp;bed.    </p>

<p>One is tempted to say it was not always this way, <br />
there was a time when rage still carried the day <br />
and indignation had not yet been defeated. <br />
Perhaps “depleted” or “exhausted” <br />
is the fitter word, for what has now gotten lost <br />
had, since the beginning, held sway; <br />
but personalities then were far more far between, <br />
and far bigger and stronger, than they seem <br />
able to loom over the smog screen today. <br />
To whom to dedicate our last indignation? <br />
The poor ape at the head of the most powerful nation? <br />
To whom to raise a last glass of rage? <br />
A house of commons with less member turnover <br />
than that of peers at the house of&nbsp;lords?    </p>

<p>These oversized feelings no one can afford <br />
(among the once-happy few who remain in the clover) <br />
will no longer buttress or shore up our culture <br />
now that all fields have been opened to pasture. <br />
Give barely literate masses a real opportunity <br />
to improve their lot, to go to high school: <br />
fortified by their number, they will uproot <br />
all that is over their head with impunity. <br />
But it is when they then attend college <br />
and take part in the pogroms of knowledge <br />
that McIgnorance dons cap and gown. <br />
One is left with no choice but to see also <br />
the positive side of things—although <br />
shit be shite only till it hits the&nbsp;ground.</p>
