<div class="subtext">
  <h2>I</h2>
  <p>Skittish joy, that gracious guest <br />
Who accepts hospitality as her own bequest, <br />
Though tantalized by <em>en suite</em> baths and showers, <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-loving-fre" href="#fn-loving-fre">Loving fresh, clean linen</a> and Medieval towers, <br />
Makes of homes, at best, transient abode <br />
And, for want of deeper comforts, frequents the road. <br />
Thus, grateful hosts always keep a room <br />
Well-aired in case they get the glooms, <br />
In hope that she, though so eclectic, <br />
Will pass that way and turn the&nbsp;trick.  </p>

<p>Long hours without her <br />
Teach the old lesson: <br />
She is taken up with power <br />
And requires it become&nbsp;obsession.  </p>

<p>Oh horror of a life that’s lived <br />
Seeking freedoms ineffective! <br />
Enough of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-lethe" href="#fn-lethe">Lethe</a>-ward spelunking, <br />
The time has come for a grand&nbsp;debunking!  </p>

<p>The world, it seems, lets travesty be made of lives <br />
Each time mediocrity so much as sighs, <br />
Despicable when it goes on and on, <br />
One’s yet surprised it’s not more common; <br />
And even if mediocrity is but part to blame, <br />
Mere effect of causes “better left unnamed”, <br />
The backwoods threat to the mind is the same: <br />
There is only one way to play this game. <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-par-ma-foi" href="#fn-par-ma-foi">Par ma foi</a>, all that one wants is praise <br />
From the sensitive bourgeois, pursuant a raise <br />
Or, better yet, a reduction of time <br />
To be served now as mime <br />
And now as <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-ostrogoth" href="#fn-ostrogoth">Ostrogoth</a>! <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-no-no" href="#fn-no-no">No, no</a>, let not your synapse be the pig-trough. <br />
All the nonsense ever spoken <br />
Defracts the sunlight shed direct <br />
Upon man’s back which grows erect <br />
In Nature’s tribute to the intellect. <br />
The last intelligentsia have let slip <br />
Their grasp to get a hand on hip: <br />
Not that I’ve anything against them; <br />
Let them all be granted tenures! <br />
In this sphery prison great effort goes <br />
Where velleity leads us by the nose, <br />
Yet if one manages to see <br />
Bodies as involucra, we’re free, <br />
Or, at least, as free as inmates become <br />
Whose sentence is a life-long one. <br />
Inklings of this—unexpected—station <br />
In the young are fair approximation, <br />
In the old, evidence that they’re off-track, <br />
The nut’s still there they couldn’t crack. <br />
Not that convicts of such conviction <br />
Don’t have problems of easy admission: <br />
If irony exists at all, it’s just <em>because</em> <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-avatars" href="#fn-avatars">Avatars</a> fall subject to the common laws; <br />
But what in a third moment may affect the first, <br />
In a second can <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-reify" href="#fn-reify">reify</a> a curse. <br />
Envy? No.&nbsp;Abomination.  </p>

  <h2><span class="caps">II</span></h2>
  <p><a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-so" href="#fn-so">So!</a>… stuck “in the pen”, let’s organize <br />
A dig, an excavation through the fuss <br />
Of the last thirty odd years of lies, <br />
Accepted now, though once they racked us. <br />
To begin <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-abovo" href="#fn-abovo"> <em>ab ovo</em></a>: Ike was in <em>the</em> Oval— <br />
Naturally, he had his fans— <br />
But acute liberal intellectuals <br />
Knew the country was wont to subtler plans, <br />
Required a more sophisticated person, <br />
Was a helm that needed the perfect man: <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-adlai" href="#fn-adlai">Adlai</a> was considered so by some <br />
And, what with <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-jack" href="#fn-jack">Jack</a> getting the gig, <br />
Ike was liked all over again: <br />
On blacks he wasn’t all that big <br />
But <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-living-his" href="#fn-living-his">living his term he kept out Nixon</a>. <br />
Perhaps the time’s single one event <br />
Fateful as all now understand <br />
Was that little <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-sputnik" href="#fn-sputnik">Sputnik</a> present <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-krushchev" href="#fn-krushchev">Krushchev put into Ike’s cold hand</a>. <br />
Ah old Nikita! Such charm, <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-so-peasant" href="#fn-so-peasant">so peasant crass</a>! <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-even-chid" href="#fn-even-chid">Even chid Mao once for the line of his descent</a>, <br />
And Mao agreed, he too had betrayed his class. <br />
But, <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-children" href="#fn-children">to children, the Sputnik brought long Lent</a>: <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-the-eagle" href="#fn-the-eagle">The eagle</a>, of a sudden, notes <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-the-bear" href="#fn-the-bear">the bear</a>, <br />
While she relaxes in her birdbath, <br />
Has almost clambered up to where <br />
He can see her and… laugh?! <br />
That oaf more adept at rockets?!! <br />
She clawed at blackboards, her wrath <br />
Ensured his cubs the picnic basket, <br />
While eaglets dieted on science and math. <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-i-saw" href="#fn-i-saw">I saw the best minds of my generation</a> <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-balance" href="#fn-balance">Balance formulae by squinting</a>, <br />
Back when a “big ego” was socially damnation, <br />
And think it’s here worth more than hinting <br />
At what fucked-up the youngsters of the nation. <br />
Back then there was the paradox of <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-sats" href="#fn-sats"><span class="caps">S.A.T.</span>s</a>: <br />
High-scoring meant to ask oneself <br />
Is competition an aberration? <br />
While those classed on a lower shelf <br />
Were brought to believe in wealth and ease. <br />
For egos and conceits it meant <br />
Those not faltering were growing <br />
Not from self-loving but dissent <br />
From all possible misinterpreting. <br />
Now this was no function to just squint at, <br />
And hence all the strange adventures <br />
Of another generation’s combat <br />
With everything from evil to loose dentures. <br />
If ever since then some high tribunal <br />
Forced one to state one’s plea, <br />
In lieu of making the court a urinal <br />
I’d say personal idiosyncrasy. <br />
The <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-pious-wish" href="#fn-pious-wish">pious wishes of the sixties</a>, <br />
If felt, had to be retracted <br />
And the decade was like a sieve, <br />
Sifting tastes, how people acted. <br />
Nor is it just coincidence <br />
That what was for most reaction <br />
Of libertine stamp against <br />
Forms of academic sanction <br />
Ended with the resigned acceptance <br />
Of privileges tied to profession; <br />
The swan song of false scruple <br />
For all but a few activists <br />
Was that their job was useful; <br />
But, I think, no doubt exists <br />
That the acme of all crisis <br />
Was the failure of “left” economists <br />
At <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-transformi" href="#fn-transformi">transforming values into prices</a>.    </p>

<p>When all the citizenry have had their share <br />
Of misinterpreting, a nation’s <br />
Only place to go from there <br />
Is general misrepresentation. <br />
I remember it as having begun <br />
After <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-stampede" href="#fn-stampede">the stampede to the libraries <br />
At every major atheneum <br />
Back in the early seventies</a>. <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-the-need" href="#fn-the-need">The need which then emerged <br />
For ostensible explanations <br />
Of the phenomenon</a>, the urge <br />
To invoke <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-those-kids" href="#fn-those-kids">those kids’ privations <br />
Or their older siblings’ excesses</a>— <br />
How to account for the poor wretches?— <br />
Like a stranger’s offer of caresses <br />
Prefigures horror in thumbnail sketches. <br />
And sure enough, negative publicity <br />
Does the trick in a way <br />
No amount of complicity <br />
Could ever have done, the sway <br />
Of public opinion is towards <br />
Puerility—unabashed and&nbsp;torturous.  </p>

<p>Such are the means that Nature’s used, <br />
Herself the headless hen abused, <br />
To assure the pen its&nbsp;wardens.  </p>

<li id="fn-even-chid">
<p>Khrushchev once teased Mao Tse-Tung, the leader of the People’s Republic of China (1949-76), for being of relatively privileged social extraction; Mao retorted that it just went to prove that <em>both</em> of them had betrayed their class of origin, implying that Khrushchev had betrayed the working classes as he had the privileged ones.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-even-chid" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-children">
<p>in the wake of the Soviet launching of Sputnik, American children had to “fast” as if it were Lent, in the sense of playing less and studying more, especially of the sciences and mathematics, as part of a national educational strategy spurred by the Space Race.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-children" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 10 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>

<li id="fn-balance">
<p>certain “wiz kids” could balance, or resolve, even complex mathematical and scientific equations and formulas without performing laborious calculations; all they had to do, apparently, was to “squint” at the formulas for the solutions to somehow appear to them.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-balance" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

</li>

<li id="fn-pious-wish">
<p>cf. Vladimir I. Lenin, <em>The Foreign Policy of the Russian Revolution</em> (1917); Lenin, leader of the Bolshevik revolution and newborn Soviet Union (1917-24), defined “pious wishes” the expectations of Russian reformists in regard to the outcome of the First World War; a not entirely dissimilar well-intentioned wishful-thinking flourished in the United States in the 1960s, not least as a result of opposition to the war in Vietnam.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-pious-wish" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-transformi">
<p>the rather arcane “problem of the transformation of values into prices” was a major theoretical stumbling block for “left-wing” (i.e. Marxian) economists in the early 1970s.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-transformi" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 17 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-stampede">
<p>the purportedly optimistic and carefree years of the 1960s in the United States, with their Hippies and exaltation of the importance of peace, love and personal relationships, came to an abrupt end in the early 1970s when a new generation of college students (the vanguard of the so-called Yuppies, or Young Urban Professionals) suddenly plunged into competitive study, especially of traditionally “useful” and highly remunerative disciplines such as Medicine and Law.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-stampede" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 18 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-the-need">
<p>at a time when Steve Reich’s best-selling <em>The Greening of America: How the Youth Revolution is Trying to Make America Livable</em> (1970) was being hailed as a <em>Summa</em> of the epoch, the pseudo-liberal, pseudo-intellectual establishment was ill-equipped to explain such a sudden “materialistic” turn in the sensibility and aspirations of the new generation of college students.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-the-need" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 19 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn-those-kids">
<p>those who entered college in the early 1970s determined to forge a new Yuppie identity for themselves, heedless of the Emersonian and Thoreauian values that had inspired their elder brothers and sisters, had been in effect completely by-passed by the 1960s “revolution”; their older siblings had already done all of the “rebelling” (and more) that seemed possible or desirable, and even the majority of the members of their parents’ generation had fallen in line with the new “hip” rhetoric of the age; in a sense, the “Youth Movement” prevented succeeding generations of adolescents from fruitfully living <em>any</em> critical experience of coming of age in society at all; the only thing left for them to do was to rebel against rebellion itself. This “<em>après moi le déluge</em>” sort of attitude was perceived with self-righteous dismay by the pseudo-liberal, pseudo-intellectual establishment only after the effects of the anthropological and cultural harm that had been done became glaringly evident.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-those-kids" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 20 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
