<h1>Prolegomena to Future&nbsp;Phenomenology</h1>



<p>Suffer me to pierce through days <br />
Of preparation and of play, <br />
All moment spent to bless the ways <br />
Of others as of myself, I pray; <br />
Again to touch indifference’s hem <br />
And be nearer thus to where, at times, <br />
When sorrow’s chalice nears the brim <br />
Solemn figures, but of human size, <br />
Reveal to one’s startled ears and eyes <br />
Eternal justice in the instant’s guise; <br />
Allow the apprentice to compose <br />
A song cast from the timeworn mold, <br />
Which will through time and space uphold <br />
Faith that, in us, the dead&nbsp;repose.</p>


</div>



<div class="subtext">
  <h2>I</h2>
  <p>Each day wakes to a more defenceless world, <br />
A veiled place <br />
Construed by evil as a base, <br />
Colonized by confusion and denial, <br />
And in a pathetic vortex hurled <br />
By the deepest, most compulsive guile. <br />
So slow now is the abysmal swirl, <br />
So fast the accustomed train, <br />
That still impressions pervade the soul <br />
And blurred is all the purport of our pain. <br />
A factitious calm then fills the chest <br />
And leads the mind to a place of quiet <br />
Where only disruption could rescue it: <br />
But who has power to disturb our rest? <br />
Certainly none who isn’t or was not once <br />
Near us in flesh and blood, within sight <br />
Or hearing, or smell, or touch; none <br />
But who in remembrance or in fact alight <br />
Upon our path, to stir the dying fire <br />
Which once set this charred world ablaze; <br />
None but whose rapt, familiar eyes conspire <br />
Against the spell of the nameless gaze. <br />
Here the human desire to excel <br />
Must meet as obstacle itself- <br />
In-others, a self extraneous, vile, <br />
Hindered from the start as well. <br />
Here privileges false and real <br />
Mark the shifting channel and bell <br />
Toxic tocsin where we now dredge <br />
The mounting dread that no longer <br />
Will the strength be found to wedge <br />
Cyphered messages into adjacent cells. <br />
Here balance and loneliness enshroud the stronger <br />
Who see and walk through poisonous mists <br />
Fighting the hardening of their heart <br />
While adding victims to their list. <br />
As natural and sure that all do climb <br />
Friendship’s citadel with the same start, <br />
At every cry of victory those left behind <br />
Have yet gained nothing from this youthful art. <br />
Hence the fact that almost all are blind, <br />
Spend life in collision and collusion, <br />
And their quarrel not consumed have still the mind <br />
To build a shadow world where light’s intrusion. <br />
Clearly I do not feel I have to beg <br />
My fellow man for reasons to be read: <br />
I sustain reasons on just one leg <br />
Though they burst my heart inside my head. <br />
And let this be said, against equivocation: <br />
The last in line to be betrayed <br />
Saw clouds billow, swirl in front, <br />
And a tragic masker wearing white <br />
Who sang a note none could confront, <br />
Beyond human expectation. <br />
He saw a tall caped silhouette <br />
Point to a round mark on the ground <br />
And say: “This is the place <br />
From which all things seem sad.” <br />
Nearing it in a later month, <br />
He vomited; and cradled one <br />
Amongst all the dead in his&nbsp;arms.    </p>

<p>Seek by the light of friendship alone <br />
Victories fissioning in defeat: <br />
Upon sudden assessments <br />
Of what is positively believed <br />
Truth is there for one to meet, <br />
Honest, unexaggerated, plain, <br />
Clad in time/space <br />
And all therein&nbsp;contained.</p>

  <h2><span class="caps">II</span></h2>
  <p>My eyes follow a line of darker hair <br />
That starts from the eye <br />
And crosses the cheek of a tan and white cat. <br />
In that space of an inch and a half <br />
Thoughts that began peaceful and fair <br />
Turn to first one, then another, <br />
And finally to all of humanity’s cry. <br />
It’s not I don’t care what anyone says <br />
As that I care what everyone says, <br />
For the silent process to which all comply: <br />
The need to extend what has given one solace, <br />
To suck in a world which would us liquify. <br />
May this be a way to keep me <br />
From too much polemicizing, from trying <br />
With my breath to stir the winds <br />
In these <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-horse-lati" href="#fn-horse-lati">horse latitudes</a> of history; <br />
So to resist the sweet tug of tiredness <br />
And write for another age, which cannot come, <br />
Having in these unremitting calms, home and origin. <br />
Time out of mind and flowing still <br />
Life’s been unsurpassable, <br />
As of a boy assigned to run downhill <br />
To tally the mules and their cartable, <br />
Nature and art concurring: their reward <br />
Is mine should I complete my errand. <br />
But nearing the bottom I found <br />
Hopes hidden under layers of common ground, <br />
Unconfessed yearnings and desire burrowing <br />
Away from fear of resurrection; <br />
While incitements to reprisal <br />
Along vale upon vale resound: <br />
“Up and Adam!”, “Up and atom!”, “Up and at ’em!”. <br />
Many’s the lifetime there I spent <br />
Paying heed to those incantations, <br />
Jostled and tossed by argument, <br />
Crash and lap of indignation; <br />
And in the midsts, at work recording <br />
All their impressions, I met my friends- <br />
Of-the-smiles, those alone embracing <br />
Schenectady and Afghanistan. <br />
They were as princes among modern men: <br />
Theirs is a story to cast light <br />
On the chronicles of a&nbsp;generation.  </p>

<p>The perusal of recent annals <br />
Begins its survey <br />
At McDonald’s <br />
On the Champs Elysées. <br />
A swarm of new-hatched <br />
Youth from the banlieue, <br />
Uncouth and sadly matched, <br />
Thrive there on electric blue <br />
And the vestiges of simulacrums. <br />
For eyes wanting to find truth, <br />
Here’s nature’s own collyrium:. <br />
Wherever hungry kids now gather <br />
Minds in themselves&nbsp;collect.  </p>

<p>A poet’s “power-base” are adults <br />
Who of their own have none: <br />
A poor lot indeed, given <br />
Conformism’s wide rampancy, <br />
Except that some be willing and exult <br />
In this: to be a poet’s constituency. <br />
Then, at their ease partaking <br />
Of a still wider solipsism, <br />
Lending it implication <br />
At their own discretion, <br />
Certain that whatever tale <br />
The poet tells is to this end— <br />
To avow a measure of truth <br />
And love to all that countervails— <br />
Then might they allow love’s seizure <br />
To bind them to the pleasure of the king; <br />
By love before Him taken <br />
They might to Him then sing. <br />
Unto such an audience <br />
Is a poet’s offering. <br />
Though to recover <br />
The great shield that deflects <br />
False points may take a lover <br />
A long time yet, <br />
That new Flaubert rediscover <br />
<a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-un-coeur" href="#fn-un-coeur"> <em>Un coeur simple</em></a> to reflect, <br />
New Hegel see the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-weltgeist" href="#fn-weltgeist"> <em>Weltgeist</em> loiter <br />
By an arch once raised to it</a>, <br />
That Einstein proffer <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-divine" href="#fn-divine">Divine limit</a> <br />
By daring every wrong, <br />
We must bury face and conscience <br />
Deep in the enfeebled&nbsp;throng.  </p>

<p>If I might speak also for my friends, <br />
The misery of the young <br />
Is to us tyranny <br />
And our worst imaginings, <br />
The result of acts imputable at large, <br />
From which we would escape by irony— <br />
In our minds, the recess bell’s still&nbsp;ringing.  </p>
