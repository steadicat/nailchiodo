<p>Having become a poet by profession <br />
who deals with his whole life by extension <br />
I cannot claim to entirely agree <br />
with Andrei Gromyko&#8217;s wry <em>boutade</em> <br />
(said to a biographer who thought his a façade) <br />
&#8220;My personal life does not interest me.&#8221; <br />
And yet, when poeticising, I feel impelled <br />
to try to peer outwards from my navel, <br />
to see not least myself &#8220;anthropologically&#8221;. <br />
It is fascinating to learn how the innermost <br />
convictions about right and wrong and a host <br />
of different aspects of people’s ideology <br />
are determined by the ways authority, <br />
property, genes, and affective priorities <br />
got divided and passed on in their family, <br />
ethnic group, part of the country, <br />
side of the street. How many hungry— <br />
not to say starving—intellects would happily <br />
have it explained to them why others <br />
can be so intractable if all men are brothers?! <br />
One might even go further and say that, <br />
in the absence of such an explanation, <br />
many a good egg will suffer disorientation, <br />
squander vital energy, fall into the trap <br />
of the enemy within, whom exhaustion fosters: <br />
“the sleep of reason generates&nbsp;monsters.”    </p>

<p>Those of us who were born into egalitarian families <br />
in which the principle of equal inheritance <br />
among siblings of either sex has total acceptance <br />
are inclined to consider banalities <br />
the distinctions between brothers and sisters <br />
and older and younger sibs that systems <br />
which favor primogeniture or other divisive <br />
attempts at maintaining property whole <br />
perpetuate in many regions of the globe. <br />
Even households in which wills are decisive <br />
in determining who gets what in the end— <br />
the so-called absolute nuclear type—offend <br />
our sense of justice, our belief in a fair share <br />
of undivided attention and the general endowment, <br />
little matter if some get shortchanged now and then. <br />
Because, when parents do not take care <br />
to make sure none of their children <br />
feels let down at home, they breed in them <br />
at best indifference, at worst resentment: <br />
wherever kids get more or less than deserved <br />
of the home-baked pie, one is forced to observe <br />
the broader social effects of such&nbsp;sentiments.    </p>

<p>Also the multifarious forms supremacy takes <br />
(to the dismay of liberals of all makes) <br />
are but projections of an original role model <br />
feared or revered within the home&#8217;s walls. <br />
One only need look just down the hall <br />
to find the living antitype of God <br />
the Father, the paternalistic or authoritarian <br />
figurehead of the selfsame household variant. <br />
Freud showed this in <em>The Future of an Illusion</em>, <br />
but the general concept that family ties— <br />
between parents and children, husbands and wives— <br />
lie behind every political and religious effusion <br />
has been a message traveling in a bottle <br />
at least since the days of Confucius and Aristotle: <br />
a theory unusable because still unfalsifiable <br />
since the comparative analysis of pertinent data <br />
from different regions and areas of the planet <br />
was, until only recently, not viable. <br />
Today, instead, it is possible to explain <br />
historical phenomena and events in ways <br />
that, up until yesterday, were <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-unfathomable" href="#fn-unfathomable">unfathomable</a>.  </p>

<p>Take, for example, the communist mindset: <br />
without wishing to aid and abet <br />
in any manner the unpardonable <br />
abuses and crimes carried out in its name, <br />
one must face the fact that the blame <br />
lies as much with the perpetrators <br />
as with the exogamous communal <br />
structure of their families, the secret tribunal <br />
of the unconscious behind the state lore. <br />
Cross-data analysis shows it was not because the Tsar&#8217;s <br />
was the weakest link in the chain, the upstart <br />
regime among those of the capitalist countries, <br />
that communism could surface there; rather, <br />
it was because, within Russia, family matters <br />
had grown so complex and caused so many anxieties <br />
that people grabbed at the chance to create <br />
a more universal system, not only to replace <br />
the family, but also to destroy it. <br />
When Lenin pulled the three-card trick in Finland Station, <br />
he claimed the paternity of the new affiliation, <br />
of the centralized confraternity of Soviets <br />
which, if it could not fulfill every promise, <br />
did blow the peasant clan a so-long&nbsp;kiss.    </p>

<p>But the destruction of the local kin system <br />
failed to extend to the values that underpinned it: <br />
liberty, once achieved, was seen as anarchy, <br />
a source of anxiety rather than of pleasure; <br />
the one and only party replaced, measure <br />
by measure, every household hierarchy, <br />
its cells reproduced the dense and intolerable <br />
living conditions of yore as closely as possible. <br />
Paternalistic authority was re-established on all levels: <br />
at the base, the secretary of each cell <br />
intervened in the private life of young couples; <br />
at the top, the great patriarchs followed upon <br />
one another like the unerring, ominous tick-tock <br />
of a great historical grandfather clock— <br />
the dynamic, talkative, and violent founding <br />
father; his sadistic successor; the fist-pounding, <br />
shoe-thumping cheerful histrionic <br />
who admitted to the excesses of his predecessor; <br />
and the quintessential senescent, who took the metaphor <br />
of the Russian political family to its natural&nbsp;limit.    </p>

<p>Communism was able to sink roots <br />
in <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-country" href="#fn-country">every other country</a> in which there brewed <br />
the same internecine tensions among relatives <br />
forced to live together under one roof. <br />
It failed to do so, instead, where the incest taboo <br />
is more relaxed and cross- or parallel-cousins <br />
are allowed, if not encouraged, to intermarry, <br />
as is most often the case amongst Arabs <br />
and in the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-whole" href="#fn-whole">Muslim world on the whole</a>.  </p>

<p>Here the anxiety-producing ritual <br />
<em>par excellence</em>—the celebration of nuptials <br />
with an outsider, whose broader role <br />
remains up for grabs—is viewed as flawed, <br />
as surely leading to conflicts that should not arise. <br />
Here almost all husbands and wives <br />
are also cuzs, their mothers- and fathers-in-law <br />
also aunties and nuncles, their nieces and nephews <br />
also future spouses, perhaps, of their own kids. <br />
Here sis, when she weds, won&#8217;t have to go live <br />
among strangers, nor will she risk being abused <br />
or having her girls killed in the cradle so that they <br />
won&#8217;t be needing a dowry (like she did!) some day. <br />
Where the fraternal bond surpasses all others <br />
in importance, particularly the paternal tie, <br />
the family stays all-powerful but fathers shy <br />
away from assuming its lead, while brothers <br />
turn instead more towards custom for guidance. <br />
In such a context, the urge to commit parricide <br />
is inoperative and atheism becomes&nbsp;inconceivable.    </p>

<p>Marxism-Leninism failed to convert <br />
also <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-peoples" href="#fn-peoples">nations and peoples</a> inclined to prefer <br />
anti-egalitarian and anti-universalistic <br />
political ideologies, which are more in line <br />
with their ethnocentric frame of mind <br />
and specific familial&nbsp;characteristics.    </p>

<p>First and foremost among these, an atavistic <br />
conviction in the supreme importance <br />
of making certain the family fortune <br />
gets passed on whole into the hands of only one son, <br />
who is under the obligation of strict obedience <br />
to the authority of his father and of allegiance <br />
to the project of preserving, possibly <em>ad infinitum</em>, <br />
their domestic biological time-capsule: <br />
a neurotic machination if ever there was&nbsp;one!    </p>

<p>Women, of course, play a central part <br />
in this psychodrama: they step in as heiresses <br />
<em>pro tempore</em> in case the parent couple fails <br />
to beget a healthy-enough male; <br />
even more importantly, they guarantee <br />
the authenticity of the blood bond within <br />
the ethnicity (<em>mater semper certa est, <br />
pater nunquam</em>), and transmit to progeny <br />
the psychological mechanisms that underlie <br />
respect for authority: hence the extremely strong <br />
behavioral norms which vertical, father-son <br />
structures have been able to pass on for&nbsp;millennia.    </p>

<p>It is impossible to escape the urge to smile— <br />
or cry, depending on how one despairs— <br />
when one views the list of peoples who uphold <br />
such authoritarian inequality in the fold, <br />
as it reads like a roster of ethnic nightmares <br />
that one will have heard about in the news <br />
if one hasn&#8217;t directly witnessed their feuds. <br />
With but few exceptions, their names <br />
evoke claims to superiority, autonomy, <br />
or neutrality—the elements of a taxonomy <br />
of scorn, or indifference, which is much the same. <br />
Still, the cultural narcissism of these groups <br />
seems intended to keep one amused, <br />
for in itself it is fairly harmless <br />
and—in small&nbsp;doses—picturesque.      </p>
