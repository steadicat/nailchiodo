<h1><span class="caps">V</span></h1>



<p>Just as scientists would hold up a mirror to Nature, <br />
so artists would turn their audience into its own object. <br />
In order to get off the ground, the project <br />
must contain the promise of power, or make sure <br />
to prompt enough hatred to spark animosity. <br />
The latter is not a way to awaken curiosity <br />
that any peace-loving artist could use, <br />
at least not on purpose; but history teaches <br />
that a work of art which actually breaches <br />
the bounds of what is expected of the Muse <br />
(by the Establishment of any time and place) <br />
is certain to provoke the rage of the same: <br />
even the famous are not made out of&nbsp;granite.    </p>

<p>I am almost what they call a senior citizen. <br />
Since the time I was born, the number of sistren <br />
and brethren who are alive on the planet <br />
has nearly tripled: over five billion <br />
new faces already pack the pavilion <br />
of this circus of ours. The changes they&#8217;ve brought, <br />
or which have occurred along with them <br />
and continue to pour out of the cistern <br />
of Earthly events, are a tremendous lot, <br />
though not all steps forward in terms of quality. <br />
In particular, attempts to reduce inequalities <br />
in basic standards of living have faltered, <br />
run up against the law of the&nbsp;jungle.    </p>

<p>In such a situation, it is easy to fumble <br />
and lose the ball as one&#8217;s audience has altered. <br />
One is no longer dealing with the small groups <br />
of intellectuals who supped on the same soups <br />
and either knew, or knew of, one another <br />
up until the middle of the last century. <br />
After all they did and said, some sort of pleasantry <br />
is still begged if one was forgotten by mother <br />
at the supermarket when only a toddler: <br />
she might have counted her kids, but why bother? <br />
Today, it is essentially as a supernumerary <br />
that one lives and can hope to reflect <br />
a living audience in an essential&nbsp;respect.    </p>

<p>Changed in essence is the figure of the luminary, <br />
of she or he who may have something to say <br />
to some part of humanity in its novel array. <br />
All with only walk-on roles in the global farce <br />
whom our one-and-only system, despite all its success, <br />
cannot help but consider as being in excess, <br />
leave to sit on the bones of their arse, <br />
deserve attention as they haven&#8217;t gotten thus far. <br />
Plainly, I&#8217;m not going to get up and start <br />
talking of hidden realities I know little about; <br />
but I would tell of treasures of which I know well <br />
having assisted to their accumulation and&nbsp;burial.      </p>

<p>One cannot expect modern-day talent scouts, <br />
who toil to feed hungry mouths and/or pay alimony, <br />
to be able to distinguish the routinely phoney <br />
from true work of genius—in the unlikely event <br />
they should ever cross paths with the latter. <br />
Since it cannot be fit into categories <br />
that are taken for granted, nothing can prevent <br />
it from being mislabeled and placed <br />
on the wrong shelf, if there still is space. <br />
There it may sit for many a decade <br />
gathering dust, until unearthed by chance <br />
or mistake, and, <em>ceteris</em> non <em>paribus</em>, seen at a glance <br />
to be, not only ahead of the times when it was made, <br />
but also sublimely beautiful, and forthright to&nbsp;boot.    </p>

<p>For example:  at some future unspecified date <br />
it might be discovered that one of the great <br />
&#8220;unanswered questions&#8221; at the root <br />
of the involution of Western culture <br />
in the final quarter of the last century&#8212; <br />
What do Bach, Beethoven, and the Beatles <br />
all have in common (besides names beginning <br />
with &#8220;b&#8221;)?&#8212;had had its own singing <br />
reply in an obscure band called the <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-weals" href="#fn-weals">Weals</a> <br />
already at the very start of the decline. <br />
Many other musicians as well had tried <br />
to extend the great synthesis twixt <br />
classical and rock modes on the model <br />
of the &#8220;four persons in one God&#8221; <br />
(as protonotary apostolic, Monsignor Jim &#8220;the gist&#8221; <br />
Sullivan, aptly defined the divine quartet); <br />
but they had invariably failed to get <br />
to the bottom of the harmonic system, <br />
of the hypercubic method of composition <br />
that Johann Sebastian, Ludwig, and those mission- <br />
pledged souls from Liverpool instead had in&nbsp;them.    </p>

<p>In reality, practically every hit song <br />
that has ever been written moves along <br />
propelled by the same felicitous mix <br />
of melodic afflatus and harmonious structure; <br />
but most represent strokes of luck, <br />
occasional, successfully pulled tricks <br />
within repertoires hardly on the par. <br />
Only a few musicians have become stars <br />
on the strength of a precise methodology <br />
in their compositional technique&#8212;I can think <br />
Ventures, Bacharach, Hendrix, but then I blink. <br />
Mine is no treatise of didactic musicology, <br />
the point I simply want to make <br />
is that there obviously exist ways <br />
to write music that quite systematically <br />
produce entirely successful results, <br />
paths that lead the spirit to exult <br />
in a manner not symptomatic of manic- <br />
depressive cycles or bipolar disorder. <br />
I forgot to mention the Motown artists, of course: <br />
they too knew what spots to put the dots on in their scores <br />
to exhilarate and empower across boards and&nbsp;borders.    </p>

<p>The Weals had carried the analysis a step further <br />
with melodies evolved from lyrics that cried murder <br />
just as the great involution, the catastrophe <br />
in the economic, political, and cultural spheres <br />
began to unfold, heralding the Age of Fear <br />
once that of Anxiety had reaped its last trophy. <br />
Such humor, such irony, such sense of purpose <br />
exude from their songs, it weighs like a curse <br />
upon the fate of America that they went unheeded <br />
when there still was more hope for her story: <br />
it would not have been the first time in history <br />
that art had provided what was most&nbsp;needed.    </p>

<p>The man behind the wheel, <a class="footnoteReference" id="fnref-Dennis" href="#fn-Dennis">Dennis</a>, <br />
has&#8212;reassuringly&#8212;kept up his tennis, <br />
gone on to write ground-breaking symphonies <br />
while most everyone else has been grooving <br />
to fusions&#8212;those of musical genres having proven <br />
easier than the nuclear to intone. <br />
His Symphony Number Three is an example <br />
of a uniquely articulate sound, like no other sample <br />
of classical music I&#8217;ve heard walking around. <br />
Listen for yourself, follow the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhc1uzdfuAc">link</a>: <br />
if what you hear doesn&#8217;t cause you to shrink, <br />
drop us a verse, let us know you&#8217;re in&nbsp;town.    </p>
