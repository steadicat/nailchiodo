<h1><span class="caps">III</span></h1>



<p>I am greatly indebted to both of those men <br />
for the helping hands they extended to me <br />
at critical moments in my writing career <br />
which, not least thanks to them, <br />
has not been untrue to my initial&nbsp;intent.    </p>

<p>To become a writer had not been my original bent, <br />
the physically more tangible realm of the visual arts <br />
having captured my fancy since the time <br />
when, as a six-year-old boy, I <br />
had had the good luck to take part <br />
in a game for kids at the St. Louis Art Museum. <br />
Displaying art works won&#8217;t make children see them: <br />
one must find ways to open their eyes <br />
to what lies right before them by steering <br />
their minds toward the objects, without interfering <br />
with reactions, spoiling the surprise. <br />
The game in question accomplished the task <br />
by allowing the cubs to walk (not run!) as fast <br />
as they could through countless vast halls <br />
and rooms of the great Beaux-Arts palace <br />
with postcards of paintings handed out at the entrance, <br />
to locate the originals hung on the walls. <br />
While all caught up in the race to finish first, <br />
how intimate one became with some of those&nbsp;works!    </p>

<p>By age ten, I could recognise at a glance <br />
the styles of dozens of artists past and present, <br />
and had even begun my personal descent <br />
into Plagiarists&#8217; Hell—as a maturing artist can— <br />
by stealing from a peer an idea I deemed peerless. <br />
I give it back now—that perfectly seamless, <br />
ideal monster at once frightful and friendly— <br />
to its creator wherever he may be, <br />
whatever may have become of him, finally, <br />
after a span of almost half a century, <br />
in this form to be felt rather than seen: <br />
may it help cover my debt and his credit&nbsp;redeem.    </p>

<p>No doubt, it is because the bases of one&#8217;s aesthetics <br />
are set by forms one learns to love when one is young <br />
that later discoveries most often fail to come <br />
anywhere near to moving one to the same extent. <br />
An artist needs also not to become too influenced <br />
by others in order to preserve, in what she or he has been through, <br />
some measure of originality. Hence the importance, <br />
especially for my own and subsequent generations <br />
of artists who have grown up in times when information <br />
is superabundant, of a healthy dose of <em>ignorance</em> <br />
about the world around them, though what <em>that</em> might be <br />
should be established before everyone&nbsp;<span class="caps">OD</span>&#8217;s.    </p>

<p>Let us say, therefore, that it was ignorance of the merits <br />
of the Contemporary Art of the day—Pop, Op, Over-the-top, <br />
we&#8217;re talking late sixties by the Midwestern clock— <br />
and not any stance that could fuel a polemic <br />
(<em>De gustibus non disputandum est</em>) <br />
that caused me to put brushes and easel to rest. <br />
At the time, I was still far from imagining myself <br />
becoming a writer of anything other than film scripts, <br />
to write which one can be almost illiterate; <br />
I began to suspect I may have needed help <br />
with basic spelling grammar and syntax <br />
only two decades later, after a relaxed <br />
silence on the part of readers had greeted <br />
my first manuscript: ten pages worked at <br />
in private for almost as many years, that <br />
represented the kernel of my highest-seeded <br />
poetico-philosophic contentions. <br />
It was like “He&#8217;s got good&nbsp;intentions!”?    </p>

<p>Fortunately, Michael, who is as fine a <em>fabbro</em> <br />
as they come, the best master craftsman <br />
a novice could hope to have his first drafts <br />
put to the anvil by, proved a real bro, <br />
in no time hammered the doggerel into verse. <br />
Aldo wrote comments to it and later work <br />
which showed that he, at least, understood <br />
what I was up to—by far and above <br />
the most redemptive act of kindness and love <br />
I shall ever have need of, knock on wood. <br />
Thanks not least to these two faithful friends, <br />
I have been able to pursue my attempt <br />
to provide a poetico-philosophical framework <br />
within which the lone voices of scattered effectives <br />
in the standing army of singing detectives <br />
may again harmonise as when their mothers gave&nbsp;birth.    </p>

<p>I am joking, of course, though only in part. <br />
Interaction between the practitioners of poetic art <br />
and philosophers, between the makers <br />
of those uniquely significant linguistic objects <br />
known as poems and the lovers of knowledge, <br />
has produced many offerings but few takers. <br />
Aldo says what I have done is lay a trap <br />
readers step into unawares: think it&#8217;s crap <br />
and you&#8217;ll find it caked on your shoes. <br />
Although it has never been my aim to ensnare <br />
anyone in anything less tender than loving care, <br />
he is right to warn them that their usual ruse <br />
might pull off its own mask in a moment <br />
if comfortable doubts turn into&nbsp;opponents.    </p>

<p>To add prosodic constraints to the rhythm of prose, <br />
as I have been doing, increases the pressure <br />
in the combustion chamber of creative expression <br />
to such a degree that only propositions in the throes <br />
of both logical and empirical truth are free <br />
to escape, in a form that fuses poetry <br />
and philosophy into a homogeneous plasm. <br />
The structure is “self-extending,” as Rorty would say, <br />
could comprise a whole singing school someday <br />
whose songs sound across once-inviolable&nbsp;chasms.    </p>

<p>You will sustain that only the most unbridled fantasy <br />
would confuse such a conceit with reality; <br />
yet the discourse seems endowed with a “tracking device” <br />
that enables it to zero in on its target object, <br />
to directly address people and tackle subjects <br />
in much the same way a harangue might, <br />
all the while maintaining a lofty perspective <br />
which keeps it from falling into vulgar invective. <br />
In this sense it appears exquisitely suited <br />
for touching upon the touchiest topics <br />
ever so lightly, as birds alight upon the tree tops, <br />
and being consigned to paper in ambassadorial&nbsp;red.    </p>
