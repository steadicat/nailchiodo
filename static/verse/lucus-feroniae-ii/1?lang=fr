<h1><span class="caps">I</span></h1>



<p>Let us pursue a line of reasoning <br />
orthogonal with respect to the left&#8217;s and the right&#8217;s, <br />
which can lift and carry us to novel heights <br />
more on the level with our deeper feelings. <br />
Poetic simplicity shall be propaedeutic <br />
to such wisdom as will pull off the trick <br />
if only we take the time to attain it. <br />
We must arm ourselves with ample leisure, <br />
avoid wasting it on the contrived pleasures <br />
propounded by the global catering system; <br />
work towards new outpourings of words <br />
easy to follow, never before heard, <br />
capable of breaking the silence soundly. <br />
In such a spirit, I now shall resume <br />
my tale of friendship in times of doom, <br />
stand by my most cherished ones&nbsp;proudly.    </p>

<p>I have also befriended stools in my day— <br />
champions of things other than fair play, <br />
who can misbehave if the occasion allows it— <br />
but their actions are never unlawful, <br />
I take them as one accepts the short straw&#8217;s full <br />
once it&#8217;s been drawn from destiny&#8217;s fist. <br />
Loving them has not always been easy— <br />
they have sometimes intensely displeased me— <br />
yet failing to do so would be a form of defeat: <br />
one must understand the violence of others <br />
if one is going to get along with one&#8217;s brothers, <br />
walk the mile, give the cloak, turn the cheek. <br />
It amounts, finally, to no more and no less <br />
than admitting to one&#8217;s own aggressiveness, <br />
whether directed outwards or&nbsp;self-inflicted.    </p>

<p>Our lust has never been for pain or for blood <br />
either within or without mind and body: <br />
there is not one of us who could be depicted <br />
as being at all inclined towards the morbid. <br />
Each in his own manner has managed to lord it <br />
over the most brutal forms of savage instinct. <br />
The world is hurting and gory enough as it is <br />
despite our protestations as pacifists, <br />
quite sufficiently so as to make us wince <br />
at the thought of what it may yet hold in&nbsp;store.    </p>

<p>All have their own ideas on that score, <br />
I suppose, most of which boil down to as many <br />
different versions of the selfsame old story: <br />
we are always in odor of some new isuppository <br />
being put safely but surely up our fanny. <br />
It seems it&#8217;s the one goal the collectivity <br />
is agreed to pursue: a sterile interconnectivity <br />
with the compliments of technological gurus; <br />
which leaves all those already connected <br />
rather more isolated, as one might have&nbsp;expected.    </p>

<p>Take, for example, the new venue YouTube: <br />
it is both a showcase and a video library; <br />
all who enter there must forgo their rivalry <br />
at least in part. Some curiosity <br />
needs be felt, some deference paid <br />
to what others might or might not have to say <br />
on so peopled a stage; all animosity <br />
is best set aside if not abandoned <br />
when one tastes the odd tidbit at random, <br />
without preconception, like the medium warrants: <br />
one doesn&#8217;t go to a jamboree to sit in the corner. <br />
It is thus at the risk of appearing quite ornery <br />
that I bring up the subject of Florence <br />
under the Medici or the Athens of Pericles <br />
as examples of topics one would be very pleased <br />
to see waxing more central to people&#8217;s concerns <br />
than, say, sewage in East Overshoe, Kansas, <br />
some confounded rhymester&#8217;s excuses for stanzas, <br />
or the length of a celebrity&#8217;s&nbsp;sideburns.    </p>

<p>In reality, I would not give a fiddler&#8217;s fandangle <br />
what it is that most commonly entangles <br />
the popular imagination but for the consequences <br />
we are all forced to bear as a result. <br />
Most of my friends are now full-grown adults, <br />
it is not up to me to examine their consciences; <br />
yet they too must perforce mind their sanity <br />
amid the zillions of bits of wired inanity <br />
our fellow citizens happily get away with. <br />
Indeed, I am certain they are much better at it <br />
than the rapidly growing number of igits <br />
who wrap up the case for this&nbsp;plaintiff.   </p>

<p>Most of us are fifty-four or older, <br />
the watershed age when even poets start to shoulder <br />
a peace treaty between reason and passion, <br />
which is usually concluded not long thereafter— <br />
Lichtenberg&#8217;s rule of thumb on the matter. <br />
The observation, however, requires a caption <br />
to the effect that one must distinguish <br />
between what, finally, is sentimental gibberish <br />
and passions one would instead be a fool <br />
to abandon anytime before the day of reckoning— <br />
immanent if not imminent after much&nbsp;beckoning!    </p>

<p>In the former category I would include <br />
an obsessive nostalgia for the Garden of Eden, <br />
for the whole egg when all soundness depends <br />
instead on splitting the white from the yolk. <br />
One can hardly expect to hear on the news <br />
that their unavowed need for true values <br />
is the deepest secret of all common folk. <br />
Their innermost aspirations would need a language <br />
in which to express themselves to better advantage, <br />
to inspire an authentic voice of the people. <br />
But the amplified utterances of the world&#8217;s masses <br />
hide the silence that reigns inside the palace <br />
since they drowned out the last sound that was&nbsp;feeble.    </p>

<p>Strict self-discipline is therefore required <br />
to preserve one&#8217;s mental health from the fire <br />
a starved imagination can light and kindle <br />
if one indulges in what the media have to say: <br />
we all know this but I repeat it anyway <br />
since the temptation is strong to give in to the swindle. <br />
Forced as we are to play a double game <br />
simply in order to survive and stay sane, <br />
let us be content with our hard-earned&nbsp;stalemate.      </p>
