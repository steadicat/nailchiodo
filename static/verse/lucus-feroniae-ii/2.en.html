<h1><span class="caps">II</span></h1>



<p>At seventy-five, Aldo is the oldest of my confrères; <br />
he is also the one who&#8217;s suffered the most wear and tear, <br />
having spent almost all of his life struggling with illness. <br />
His particular ailment—manic depression—is especially cruel <br />
because it plays with the imagination and lends fuel <br />
to the illusion that it may be but an imaginary sickness. <br />
When its victim is someone as imaginative as he is, <br />
the pain and havoc it wreaks is positively heinous. <br />
But there is always a pinch of logic in madness, <br />
as there is always a pinch of folly in love, <br />
and Aldo is a lover like no other I know of. <br />
His wild euphoria and unspeakable sadness <br />
are as the two sides of a spinning coin: <br />
quenching, smothering the fire in his loins, <br />
alone has stopped his mind, albeit briefly, from&nbsp;reeling.    </p>

<p>“Man was made to suffer” goes the saying, <br />
“and woman was made to feel the pain” <br />
continues the story upon further reading. <br />
Undeniably, Aldo seduced both of his wives <br />
and all of his mistresses, made their lives <br />
as symbiotic with his own as he could; <br />
which implied, of course, making them privy <br />
to the private hell in which he was living <br />
in greater detail than can have been good. <br />
His numerous women, of whom I&#8217;ve had the honor <br />
to meet more than a few, were practically goners <br />
from the moment they first opened-up to him, <br />
such was the strength of his hold on&nbsp;them.    </p>

<p>All Aldo&#8217;s ladies could not solve his problem, <br />
sooner or later they each had to give in; <br />
together, however, they have kept him alive, <br />
a labor of Hercules that in time gave rise <br />
to one of the great literary accomplishments <br />
of the century recently come to an end. <br />
For my very friend is a veritable Prince Hamlet <br />
whose complex writings conceal an attempt <br />
to avenge the foul murder of his&nbsp;father.    </p>

<p>He could not be content with apologies offered <br />
by a society which still continued to breed <br />
the same internecine violence that had sealed the fate <br />
of his dad and uncle at the hands of the State. <br />
Since then, there had been a change of regime, <br />
the butchered siblings were acclaimed as heroes <br />
and his family name was put right next to those <br />
of the Fathers who had founded the Fatherland <br />
in every street index throughout the country. <br />
But, being thirsty for justice and hungry <br />
for the freedom that true honesty demands, <br />
nor could he pretend that everything had not changed <br />
only so that everything might stay the same <br />
yet again in the serial nightmare of&nbsp;history.    </p>

<p>We met some thirty years ago through Michael, <br />
a grand master&#8212;of whom I was the disciple&#8212; <br />
in the art of putting the philosophical bisturi <br />
to philistines, pharisees, and other tartuffes. <br />
Strangers probably took us for three poofs <br />
when we went out carousing together, <br />
so did we revel in each other&#8217;s company. <br />
The real nature of our intercourse trumped <br />
even those who were closest to us, however, <br />
for the bonding of certain artists with one another <br />
is not unlike that between sisters and brothers <br />
born as deaf dumb and blind Siamese twins. <br />
More particular still since we were triplets, <br />
we used our own private braille in order to get <br />
to know one another tactfully, to conjointly spin <br />
the thread of a shared awareness and&nbsp;conscience.    </p>

<p>To the task of conducting our general conference, <br />
we each brought a varied experience, wrapped in <br />
characterological packaging that differed as did our ages. <br />
With our forty-, thirty-, and twenty-five years, stages <br />
of the life of man were represented that normally, <br />
according to old wives&#8217; tales of romance, <br />
are associated with decreasing sexual performance; <br />
in our case, instead, we were all still pretty horny. <br />
Nor had it escaped our keen observation <br />
that looks count—Aldo even clinched a relation <br />
with the cisalpine clone of Romy Schneider— <br />
but none was ever less homely than the Muse <br />
and it was always She who did the choosing: <br />
we had only to listen carefully to our desires <br />
so as not to wind up in survival&nbsp;school.    </p>

<p>After wallowing like walruses in the Roman pool <br />
for those years when one still could do so, <br />
before it turned far too overcrowded <br />
with utterly unpalatable fish, “<em>laudate</em>” <br />
we now sing in the rare, carved-out hollow <br />
still hallow enough to tread water in. <br />
If only we could say our convictions were faltering, <br />
that perhaps we&#8217;d been wrong from the start! <br />
Our sharp tusks and thick skin spelt our demise: <br />
no one, I think, was very surprised <br />
the day the bold <em>Davidsbund</em> fell apart. <br />
In our hearts, however, we could never give up <br />
making practice against Goliaths&nbsp;lilliputian!    </p>
