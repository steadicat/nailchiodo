<h1><span class="caps">IV</span></h1>



<p>My poetry does not go down well with some of my colleagues, <br />
who refuse to meet me even for coffee, <br />
do not answer my letters, and will not explain <br />
what it is about it that so offends their taste. <br />
I would not give a damn, much less waste <br />
precious breath denouncing their cowardly game <br />
did they not occupy posts of authority <br />
in important milieus, were not the poverty <br />
of their visions a lion in the path of knowledge. <br />
If they do not consider the latter&#8217;s pursuit <br />
an end sufficient unto itself, what kind of fruit <br />
can it bear in their reviews, at their&nbsp;college?    </p>

<p>Imaginative culture seems to many unwholesome, <br />
transcending—as it necessarily does—the limits of both <br />
the naturally possible and the morally acceptable; <br />
but that is precisely its essential function, <br />
to shock the upright bourgeois, cause convulsions <br />
in those whose containment&#8217;s impeccable, <br />
tear down barricades of imaginations smug <br />
and complacent, pull the worn-out rug <br />
from under the feet of cultural establishments: <br />
all things more easily said than actually done, <br />
to be sure, especially in contexts such as the one <br />
we live in today, where nothing appears to be banished <br />
and anything goes as long as it stays in its&nbsp;place.    </p>

<p>I cannot be certain that this is the case <br />
as far as those buttoned-up poets are concerned— <br />
the techniques of evasion they slyly have chosen <br />
to avoid taking positions out in the open <br />
allow only guesswork until more is learned— <br />
but the lame excuses one has come up with <br />
to justify the disappearing act that he did <br />
after he had had a chance to examine my verses <br />
suggests they have indeed hit a vulnerable spot <br />
in the irremovable armor of that titled&nbsp;lot.    </p>

<p>Of what relevance to us is this excursus? <br />
It brings to our attention a hidden scandal <br />
that leaves more than one of us holding a handle, <br />
while all our ponderable cultural baggage <br />
has dropped like dead weight to the floor. <br />
Flung back on the street by revolving doors <br />
and bouncer-like critics who block all without badges, <br />
we&#8217;ve no choice but to accept the deal, <br />
settle for a banana, and slip on its peel. <br />
But, in a world more and more like a circus, <br />
it seems less and less foolish to be cast as&nbsp;clowns.    </p>
