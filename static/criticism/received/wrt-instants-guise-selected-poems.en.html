    <p>Comments by Mark Morgan Ford, Christopher Ricks, Rosanna&nbsp;Warren</p>

  <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I think it is a great achievement&#8230;. I admired the work that went into all the beautifully crafted poems in the first part and was totally drawn into the confessional stuff toward the end. It was a poetic page turner!&#8221; &#8212; Mark Morgan&nbsp;Ford  </p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>… Would I have read every page of In the Instant’s Guise had you not sent me the book
and had I not felt an obligation towards you&#8230;? The answer, which is enough to put
me — I&#8217;m afraid — in an unwelcome or unwelcoming position, is No. But if I follow
this with a cognate question to myself, Would I have been the loser had I not read
every page &amp;c.?, then the answer is Yes. For there are instants throughout, instances
throughout, when I am glad to be in debt to a poet who is perceptive and who not
only notices things but notices relations between the things that he notices (in my
eyes and ears, a crucial ability)&#8230;.&#8221; &#8212; Christopher&nbsp;Ricks  </p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>An ambitious volume, sort of a post-mod Wordsworthian Preludes, formation of a poet&#8217;s mind. Very funny in moments, in its jouncing rhymes and puns; erudite in its promiscuous and ebullient misquotations (i.e. abundant literary references, always slightly off-kilter, on purpose)
 and allusions; naughty.&#8221; &#8212; Rosanna&nbsp;Warren</p>
